fish with salt and pepper . Fish and red wine don't go 
together . Fish and meat are both nourishing , but the latter 
is more expensive than the former . Fishing is not in my

the company millions of dollars . You never get something for nothing

a person his life . I would hate to become just a

enough that he usually came to work late , but coming in

let him go . You can have this book for nothing .

the line . The line is busy now . He's gone to 
Nagoya on business . We're out of stock now . I will 
be with you right away . The line is engaged . I'm

light . I just wish we could leave this horrible place . 
I think it's worth asking . Flying a kite can be dangerous 
. The kite got caught in the tree . Takeshi raised his 
hand to ask a question . Takeshi keeps a diary in English 
. Takeo is engrossed in solving mathematical problems . It will be 
quicker to walk than to take a taxi . It's faster to 
reserve a taxi . I had a little difficulty in getting a 
taxi . I had trouble getting a taxi . I held up 
my hand to stop a taxi . Let's get out of the 
taxi . Could you please get me a taxi ? Would you 
like me to get you a cab ? I'll call you a 
taxi . Would you like me to call a taxi ? The 
taxi picked up two passengers . No taxi stopped . Let's take 
a taxi . Why don't we take a taxi ? Shall we 
take a taxi ? I left my umbrella in the cab . 
I think you should go by taxi . The taxi has arrived 
. The taxi is waiting outside . I want a lot . 
It is nice to have a lot of friends . There are 
many books , aren't there ? I've had enough , so my 
stomach is full . You have made many mistakes . Lots of 
famous people come here . Many famous artists live in New York

your face with a towel . The Dow Jones average posted a 
gain of two points today . Where is the bus stop for 
downtown ? Traffic downtown is all backed up . There are many 
hotels downtown . How about Thai food ? I have to change 
tires . You don't see many dial phones around anymore . We 
found a nail stuck in the tire . Could you check the 
tire pressure ? I pumped up the tire . I must put 
some air in the tire . Fill the tires with air . 
The tire leaks air . I got a flat tire . I 
got a flat tire . Could you bring me a Time magazine 
? Do you have Time magazine ? It has become very warm 
. It's a very good newspaper , isn't it ? There were 
so many people . It was a very cold winter . Much 
to my surprise , my song appealed to many young people . 
The pain has mostly gone away . Can I use your typewriter 
? You can type , can't you ? In Thailand it has 
already become too dry to grow rice in some parts of the 
country . I usually walk . I usually have a glass of

home the bacon . Most Americans like hamburgers . I usually gas 
up the car at this service station . You're about right . 
On the whole I am satisfied with the result . About how 
much will it cost ? About how long will it take ? 
It's almost six o'clock . We didn't have much trouble . They 
had not gone very far when they met an old man . 
We didn't have much fun . That doesn't matter . Hotshot ! 
Hotshot ! It isn't much of a car . I'd like a 
daiquiri . In most cases , his answers are right . The 
Tigers lost the game , which was a surprise to us . 
There's little chance of keeping slim , unless you stick to a 
diet . The chocolate cake tempted her even though she was dieting 
. She's lost a lot of weight since she went on a 
diet . Why don't you go on a diet ? Diane is 
your half-sister too , George . We buy eggs by the dozen 
. Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution ? You shouldn't read 
such useless books . It is dangerous to drive so fast . 
You don't have to obey such a law . I might as 
well die as lead such a life . Don't talk back to 
me like that . Don't talk like that . Don't repeat such 
a careless mistake . Don't make such careless mistakes . Such a 
strange thing is not likely to happen . I've never seen such 
a beautiful flower . Don't give me such a sad look . 
That's impossible . Don't ask such hard questions . Don't ask me 
such a hard question . I didn't know you were that kind 
of a person . You should not speak so loud . Don't 
talk so loud . I cannot afford to pay so much . 
I can't imagine such a life . I might as well die 
as marry such a man . It isn't worthwhile going there . 
You can't fool me with a trick like that . Such incidents 
are quite common . Pardon me for saying so . It's thoughtless 
of her to say so . He must be crazy to say 
such a thing . The mother told her daughter to do it 
herself . Forget about that right now . Oh , don't worry 
about that . You know I can't. I never thought he was 
capable of doing something so cruel . I can't buy a book 
this expensive . I can't afford to buy such an expensive car 
. Buying such an expensive car is out of the question . 
There is no excuse for such behavior . It is stupid of 
you to make such a mistake . She was stupid to make 
such a mistake . Such a plan is bound to fail . 
I don't feel like it . I've never heard of such a 
strange story . I don't want to take risks . You ought 
to know better than to go to such a dangerous place . 
Don't make such a mistake . It was careless of him to 
make such a mistake . You should avoid making such a mistake 
. I cannot afford to buy such a thing . I don't 
believe such things to exist . I've never been spoken to like 
that . That's how he got away from prison . Stop staring 
at me like that . Don't worry about that . That's for 
suckers . It was out of the ordinary for Chris to behave 
so roughly . You shouldn't speak so ill of him . Don't 
be so angry . I had not waited long before the bus 
came . Don't walk so fast . Don't speak so fast , 
please . Don't run so fast . Don't speak so fast .

You did not need to come so early . I can't keep 
up with you if you walk so fast . Don't eat so 
much . You'll get fat . Don't cut your classes so often 
. Please don't look at me like that . Don't get so 
excited ! Don't hit me so hard . Nobody anticipated such a 
sharp decline in interest rates . You need not have come in 
such a hurry . Don't be in such a hurry . There's 
no need to get so angry . Don't raise my hopes like 
that . It's not so far . Please don't make so much 
noise . You shouldn't smoke so much . Don't change your mind 
so often . Don't eat like a pig . Don't worry about 
money so much . Cut out the nonsense , will you ? 
I didn't quite catch the name of that designer . I didn't 
mean it . Don't bother me with such trifles . Don't worry 
about such a trivial problem . You need not fret over such 
trifles . That can't be true . Don't take it literally . 
He is inclined to exaggerate . Such a thing is of no 
account . I can scarcely believe it . That's easy for you 
to say . That's easy for you to say . Don't say 
that . Don't say that . You ought not to say such 
a thing . Don't give me that . Stop saying that ! 
I never heard anything like that . It is not characteristic of 
you to say such a thing to her . You must on 
no account do such a thing . Don't worry about such a 
thing . You ought not to say such things in public . 
I don't like those who say so . If you say so 
, you are telling a lie . It makes my head swim 
to hear you say that . She must be stupid to say 
such a thing . It is careless of you to say such 
things . I cannot bring myself to do such a thing . 
It was very careless of her to do such a thing . 
It's nonsense to try that . I'm sorry for what I did 
. Trying to do such a thing is a waste of time 
. That won't make any difference . I've never heard of such 
a thing . I've never heard of such a thing . It 
is absolutely impossible . I don't go in for that sort of 
thing . You'll regret having said those words . I don't want 
to get involved in that sort of thing . I don't want 
to get involved in that business . What's the point ? I 
wouldn't dream of letting you do that . I'll be damned if 
it's true . That cannot be true . It's as easy as 
pie . Nobody will believe that rumor . I cannot accept an 
excuse like that . It's time to get down to business . 
It's about time for dinner . It's about time we went back 
. It's almost time to go to bed . It's about time 
we went to bed . I think I have to begin working 
on my homework . I'm afraid I have to go now . 
It's about time . We should start getting Christmas gifts for the 
children . It's about time you sent the children to bed . 
I'm taking off now . It's time you faced reality . It's 
about time I was going home . We'd better go home now 
. It's about time we brought this party to an end , 
isn't it ? I think it's time to wind up this meeting 
. Pick it up . Turn it off . They have never 
been heard of since . He has never been heard of since 
. We have been friends ever since . Have you been here 
since ? Three years have passed since then . He has not 
been heard of since . I had never seen a more beautiful 
sight . You can't expect more than that . He led a 
hard life after that . I haven't seen her since then . 
I cannot take less . It is far from easy to understand 
it . It is far from easy to understand it . Send 
it by mail . Will you send it by mail ? Please 
bring it back tomorrow . Just wrap it up . Let's get 
it over with . Let me hear it . I am sad 
to hear it . I'm very sorry to hear that . I'm 
very glad to hear that . I'm sorry to hear that . 
I'm sorry to hear it . I am very much relieved to 
know that . I'm so sorry to hear that . I'd like 
to see that in black and white . Will you explain it 
in plain English ? Cut it in half . Don't blame it 
on her . He has enough money to buy it . It 
cost him five pounds to buy it back . I don't know 
how to put it in Japanese . May I try it on 
? Give it to anyone you like . Say it in another 
way . I'd like to have that gift wrapped . You ought 
to have told me that before . I believe it to be 
true . I believe it to be true . Let's make it 
brief . It's naive of you to believe that . Can you 
prove it ? It took me several hours to write it . 
Look it up in the dictionary . I need a bag to 
carry it in . Bring it to me . That's just what 
I was going to say . Bring it back to me . 
Buy it for me , please . Let me have a look 
at it . Please send it to me by fax . Give 
it to me , please . Send it by airmail . I 
wish you had told me that . Put it back where you 
got it from . I left it unlocked . Put it back 
where it was . I was extremely surprised when I saw this 
. I would like to see it . Let me see that 
. Let me see that . It took many years to build 
it . Don't hold it upside down . We still have enough 
time to discuss it . Put it back on the desk . 
Can you put it down on the table ? Can you make 
it on time ? You must take care not to break it 
. Where did you get this ? Set it down there . 
Put it down . Don't expose it to the rain . Drink 
it down . Leave it off the list . Try and do 
it . I could not find it anyplace . Tell me what 
to do with it . I don't know what to open it 
with . What are you going to do with it ? Lay 
it on the table . Leave it there . I wish I 
had known how to do it . It's up to you to 
do it . You'll need a special tool to do it . 
It is impossible to do it . I don't know how I 
should do it . Let's finish it right away . Get it 
ready at once . Do it at once . May I do 
it right now ? What is the harm in doing that ? 
I will give you permission to do it . It's not us 
who did it . Did you show it to your parents ? 
Bring it here . Get them out of here ! I will 
give it to you . I sold it for ten dollars . 
I bought it for 10 dollars . I can read them all 
. Pack them in the box . Isn't that theirs ? All 
of them were handmade things . They aren't my books . They 
are our cars . They are my grandfather's books . What are 
they for ? What are they made of ? They are very 
big apples . They are more or less the same size . 
They were made of rough brown leather . They are made in 
a variety of sizes . I've been to neither of those places 
. I've been to neither of those places . Show me the 
photos , please . Those children are potential customers . Those children 
have no one to care for them . Those countries used to 
belong to France . The cattle are marked with brands . Those 
pictures were painted by him . Those flowers have died . Please 
put those chairs away . Those chairs are in the way . 
One of the dogs is alive . Many of the dogs are 
alive . Some of the dogs are alive . I'd rather stay 
here . I like this better than that . That's not a 
bad idea . That sounds too good to be true . That 
is a good idea . Keep it in a cool place . 
It's about the size of an egg . It looks like an 
egg . It is about the size of an egg . It 
is about the size of an egg . It was about the 
size of an egg . It would break if you dropped it 
. It has a wingspan of about four inches . It is 
a disease that can't be prevented . It went just as we 
expected . That's too much of a good thing . That's not 
a useful piece of information . It's for a friend of mine 
. That's my sole concern . That was cooked in oil . 
That's a useful piece of information . That is a useful piece 
of information . It's out of the question . It may give 
rise to serious trouble . That is out of the question . 
That will complicate matters more . Is it made of wood or 
metal ? It is more than I can stand . That sounds 
interesting . You can have it for nothing . It's free of 
charge . It came to nothing . It sounds like a dream 
. It cannot be true . Can it really be mine ? 
It has to be true . That's really a great idea . 
It is really wonderful . It can not be true . It 
can't be true . It can't be true . Can it be 
true ? I think it's true . I think it's true . 
That might have been true . It turned out to be true 
. She said that it might be true . It may or 
may not be true . It may be true . It is 
a book . It is essentially a question of time . I 
want to do it myself . That is not exactly what I 
said . That is the same color as mine . Those are 
my trousers . It is on me . It was a great 
shock to me . It was too difficult for me . It 
was too difficult for me . That is the sort of job 
I am cut out for . That's against the law . It 
was a one-sided love affair . I am tired of hearing it 
. It's a fact you can't deny . It was only a 
partial success . It is both good and cheap . That's hard 
to say . It is necessary . It is of great use 
. It was such a boring speech that I fell asleep . 
Keep it quiet . It's secret . What a shame ! It 
was a party to celebrate her birthday . I think she made 
up that story . It was the first gold medal that she 
had won . It was a mistake on their part . That 
is no business of his . Ask him about it . It 
was a very good experience for him . That applies to him 
too . It happened two days after he got back to Tokyo 
. It happened between eight and ten . That was an exciting 
game . Everybody was excited . It's white . That's just a 
cheap publicity stunt . I'm not going to sell it . Is 
it Japanese food ? That's a tall order . It is a 
difficult problem . It isn't hard to do . I found the 
book easy . It's neither good nor bad . It's not a 
road , but a path . It's not a suitable topic for 
discussion . That's a hard question to answer . It serves you 
right . It is a typical Gothic church . That's beside the 
point . That's common sense . It is on the left side 
of the street . Is it a direct flight ? You can't 
fix it . You should buy a new one . He thought 
that it was like a bird cage . It is thirty meters 
in length . It was a long letter . Is it a 
butterfly or a moth ? It will threaten the prosperity of the 
town . Does that price include breakfast ? It's merely a joke 
. I think it is a mere coincidence . Whose idea was 
it ? It's the same for everyone . Anyone can do it 
easily . Anybody knows it . That's quite a problem . Please 
have someone else do it . It is of great value . 
It is such an old song that everybody knows it . That 
is quite possible . That was of great help to me . 
It may well be true . It's an artificial flower . It 
has cost me $100 altogether . That's 3000 yen altogether . I 
don't like it at all . That is quite absurd . That 
makes no sense at all . That's altogether wrong . That's a 
completely unfounded rumor . That's absolute nonsense . You can't buy it 
under 1,000 yen . What exactly does that mean ? That's a 
doll . This is a real popular item . The honor is 
more than I deserve . That is not the case . That 
is not the case . That is all right . It isn't 
new . It is new . It's a delicate problem . It 
is soft to the touch . I just meant it as a 
joke . That's an excellent wine . It will cost at least 
five dollars . That's news to me . Since it's important , 
I'll attend to it . It needs to be repaired . You 
are telling it second hand , aren't you ? It is just 
an act . That is an actual fact . It is really 
quite a good story . Is it yours ? Is it yours 
? It's a dictionary . It is regarded as a matter of 
time . It's a waste of time . It's a waste of 
time and money . It gave me the creeps . That's my 
affair . That is not my line . It's in my jacket 
pocket . That's my dictionary . It's for my personal use . 
It fell short of my expectation . It's for my family . 
Is it anything like mine ? It isn't mine . It makes 
no difference to me . It is nothing to me . It 
was a revelation to me . It's too difficult for me . 
That's good news to me . It happened prior to my arrival 
. I am to blame for it . It's not something I'm 
very good at . It's the best book that I've ever read 
. That is not what I meant to say . The landscape 
is unfamiliar to me . It is a childish act . It 
cannot be helped . It is only too true . It's easy 
to make and it's cheap . It's an embarrassing question . It 
has become quite common . Is it not black ? It is 
too expensive for me to buy . That's too expensive . We 
got a good price for that . It isn't expensive . This 
isn't fair . That's not a proper thing to say . I 
don't think that was a wise decision . Leave it where you 
found it . It is not as good as it looks . 
It is by no means certain . That's your funeral . That 
won't help you . That's your responsibility . It is just your 
imagination . It is up to you . Is it near your 
house ? You can't mistake it . That has nothing to do 
with you . It is not so difficult as you think . 
It happened by accident . Was it by accident or by design 
? That is surprising . That is the principle problem next to 
education . It was a terrible accident . It happened last October 
. That's a copy . How did you like it ? It 
tasted sweet . Is it sweet or sour ? I'll look forward 
to it . It's certainly a waste of time . It came 
apart . It was found at the bottom of the river . 
It was a problem difficult to solve . It serves our purpose 
. It was a blow to us . You can do it 
at your leisure . It is neither good nor bad . It 
was ages ago . What is the story ? What does it 
refer to ? That may easily have been a mistake . It 
is cheaper than chemical fertilizers . Isn't that an English book ? 
That's an incredible story . I put it in the drawer . 
It is made partly of wood . I'll be able to finish 
in a day or two . I'm afraid you're mistaken . Wow 
! That's cheap ! It was a nightmare . I made it 
myself . It's against the rules . It's about 133 kilometers from 
London . It looks like an apple . That's an old trick 
. It smells delicious . I can't help it . It's worth 
a try . I think it's worth a try . I think 
it's worth a try . It would be better to try . 
Keep it at a lower temperature . It is written in easy 
English . It must be done more carefully . I didn't mean 
to put that on there . It's already out of fashion . 
It's already out of fashion . You should leave it for tomorrow 
. It was hard as rock . It was like watching a 
slow motion movie . That's quite meaningless . It was just as 
I thought . It's all up to you . It happened completely 
by accident . It has nothing to do with you . It's 
entirely up to you . Let's reserve that for another occasion . 
It was just something I read in a newspaper . It was 
nothing less than a miracle . It was nothing but a joke 
. It was nothing but a joke . That was only a 
year ago . It was a very exciting game . It is 
sold by the pound . It makes little difference . It is 
next to impossible . It's almost over . It is of little 
value . It is Pochi's food . It is not far away 
from the hotel . It's a sunflower . It's a sunflower . 
That's terrible . That's very naughty of you . That is the 
same umbrella as I found on the bus . It fell to 
pieces . That is the same umbrella that I found on the 
bus . What an interesting story it is ! How long it 
is ! What a ridiculous opinion that is ! That's nonsense . 
Nobody but a fool would believe it . What animal is it 
? What kind of play is it ? That is a trivial 
problem . You find it in any dictionary . Which theater is 
that ? Which gate is that ? How long ago was that 
? That was so good a book that I read it three 
times . That was no ordinary storm . It was a most 
beautiful flower . It was a very traditional ceremony . It was 
a very big room . It's beyond me . You can put 
it anywhere . Where is it hidden ? I wouldn't be so 
sure about that . It's a TV . It must be hard 
for you . It happened quite recently . You're carrying this too 
far . It's sort of strange . That was exactly what she 
intended . That's exactly what I want . It grew larger and 
larger . I got it free . That's quite a story . 
It was such a shock . I thought that would be a 
great idea . That's a splendid idea . I had rented it 
the day before . They were all sold out . It all 
depends on the weather . That's a brilliant idea . It's a 
wonderful work of art . That's a great idea . That's a 
bright idea . It was all covered with dust . That was 
some storm . You'd better not do it . That pool really 
looks inviting . It's just another story . It's junk . Throw 
it away . It is quite a big number . It is 
a kind of orange . When does it begin ? I have 
no idea how much it costs . I think it's a good 
idea . You made a good decision . It is true in 
a sense . Is that a common name ? It's not worth 
much . That's really sad . It is none of your business 
. That is not your knife . It begins at six-thirty . 
It is four centimeters thick . It was three days ago . 
I calculated that it would cost 300 dollars . It was a 
ship with a crew of 25 sailors . It was about twenty 
dollars . It will cost around 10000 yen . I'll be able 
to finish it in a day or two . It can be 
done in a day . It will be finished in a day 
or two . It will cost around fifteen dollars . There is 
one big difference . It happened at a quarter past eleven . 
It was a one hundred dollar bill . That won't work . 
This is too important to overlook . Does that price include tax 
? I meant it as a joke . What is it ? 
It's my favorite food . It was an exciting story and he 
told it well . It was Sir Anthony's eightieth birthday concert and 
everybody wanted a ticket . Its color is red . It will 
cost about 2000 yen to repair it . I couldn't think of 
anything better than that . It has no parallel . I don't 
remember agreeing to that . Nothing can be better than that . 
Count me in . Let's shake on it . Keep away from 
that . I took a taxi to get there in time . 
I remember hearing a very similar story to that . Add more 
water to it . Will there be an extra charge for that 
? You mustn't touch it . Is there a service charge for 
that ? It has my name on it . I didn't notice 
it . I have some doubts about it . Let's talk about 
it after school . I don't understand much about it . I'll 
give you a day to think about it . I will say 
something about it . It is no use arguing about it . 
Do you have any ideas about it ? May I make a 
suggestion about it ? Could you explain it in more detail ? 
He knows hardly anything about it . You may take my word 
for it . What do you think about it ? How did 
you see that ? I paid 10 dollars for it . In 
that case , I'll change my mind . You should have said 
so earlier . This and that are two different stories . You've 
done more than enough . That is why I am angry with 
him . That would be fine . Nevertheless , many are choosing 
early retirement . All the same , we still need a scientific 
account of how exactly pains are caused by brain processes . That's 
reversing the logical order of things . That will do me well 
. Well , let's talk turkey . That would leave me in 
a fix . Let us turn now to the fundamental issue . 
See you at two this afternoon . That's against the contract . 
That will put you in danger . Now let's hurry to school 
. The angle would be too narrow . That means sure death 
! It will get you nowhere . Now let me entertain you

America . If he did not watch so much television , he 
would have more time for study . It is strange that he 
should be put up at such a cheap hotel . It is 
strange that he should say such a thing . I can't bear 
to see him cry like that . What he says makes no 
sense at all . I have a general idea of what he 
means . What he said about England is true . I don't 
understand his reluctance to go . Please tell me when he'll arrive 
here . It is not certain when he came here . I 
don't know when he will come here . I don't know when 
he entered the building . Don't bother with what he said .

he will come back . I don't know for certain when he

when he will come ? I do not know for certain when 
he will come . You are doubtless aware of his absence .

a lie . It was obvious that he was lying . It

you . I caught him cheating in the examination . I'll give 
him your message when he comes . We will begin the party 
when he comes . I will go when he comes back . 
I will start after he comes . Let's begin the discussion after 
he comes . He cannot have been there yesterday . I expect 
him to come . I wonder where to hang the picture he 
gave me . It is a pity that he should miss such 
a chance . I'm disappointed that he's not here . I wish 
he were here . It is strange that he is not here 
. He always comes at this time . When he was here 
, he would swim in the morning . I'll tell him so 
when he comes here . I want to know if he will 
come here . I believe that he comes here . I don't 
know when he will be here . I saw him come this 
way . It is true that he accepted this job . It'll 
take him two days to finish this work . He laid out 
this garden . He must have entered this room . He can't 
have read this book . I stayed so he wouldn't feel lonely 
. I never saw him in jeans . He comes back from 
Sydney today . I suggested that he go there at once . 
I do hope that he will get well soon . It is 
quite common for him to say so . He cannot have said 
so . He had every reason for doing so . Since he 
says so , it must be true . What he said is 
true . He may be there . I was surprised to see 
him there . He has his reasons for staying there . It 
will be dark by the time he gets there . He was 
heard singing the song . He made the company what it is 
today . He is the man who drew the picture . He 
is in charge of the class . He made up for the 
deficit . It took him a week to finish the work . 
It will take him two hours to finish the work . He 
was responsible for the car accident . He designed the car . 
Whether he wrote the novel or not is not known . He 
designed the new building . It is possible for him to swim 
across the river . He assumed full responsibility for it . His 
acceptance of the present was regarded as bribery . It was natural 
that he should win the contest . It will take him at 
least two years to be qualified for that post . This is 
the hut in which he lived . None of us knew his 
decision to win the long-distance race . It must be easy for 
him to find the way . It is certain that he didn't 
go out that day . We know nothing except that he did 
not come home that day . It cost him ten dollars to 
get the ticket . I have the impression that he knows the 
secret . The marvel is that he succeeded in the adventure . 
It is difficult for him to solve the problem . It is 
natural that he should refuse that request . He made up the 
story . I can't believe that he is that depressed . It 
is impossible for him to do it . It is evident that 
he did it . He cannot have done such a thing . 
It is a pity that he died so young . It will 
be difficult for him to get up so early . He came 
out of a room at last . I don't know if he 
locked the door . Nobody could tell what he meant by that 
. No one can imagine what has become of him . I 
don't know what has become of him . I have no idea 
how he escaped . I stepped aside for him to pass . 
Do you know where he bought his camera ? No one could 
tell where he was . Tell me exactly where he lives . 
I have no idea where he lives . I don't know where 
he comes from . Do you know where he went ? I 
don't know where he went . I have no idea where he 
has gone . He was naturally very angry . Tell me how 
he got it . I don't know what plan he will try 
. I don't know what he is like . I can't figure 
him out . He hit me , not her . I can't 
figure out why he said so . It is a mystery why 
he did not finish the poem . I can't figure out why 
he did it . It's obvious why his stomach hurts . It 
is a mystery why he quit his job . Do you know 
why he put off his departure ? Don't trust him no matter 
what he says . I can hardly make out what he says 
. He is anything but a fool . As soon as he 
got on the bus , it began to move . He played 
the piano and she sang . She insisted that he play the 
piano . I found him lying on the bed . I gave 
him as much food as he wanted . He won the race 
again . He hasn't come yet . It is strange that he 
has not come yet . I saw him playing cards with all 
of them . Let's wait here till he comes back . If 
he had studied harder , he would have passed the exam . 
I wish he would write more often . I'll get the work 
done by the time he gets back . When he came , 
we were having dinner . It is clear that he is guilty 
. He thought of a good solution . Do you often hear 
from him ? I couldn't get a definite answer from him . 
I have heard nothing else from him yet . I have had 
no news from him yet . I have heard nothing from him 
for five years . He was a great influence on me . 
I have heard nothing from him . He wrote to me yesterday 
. I had a phone call from him . Have you heard 
from him ? Is it true that he won the race ? 
I'm pretty sure he came late on purpose . He acted as 
our guide . I was annoyed with him for interrupting me . 
You are mistaken if you think he is wrong . If he 
had taken his doctor's advice , he might still be alive . 
She would often hear him grumbling to himself . It is true 
that he won first prize . When he retired , his son 
took over his business . It's obvious that you told a lie 
. It is possible that he is telling a lie . I 
knew all along that he was telling a lie . The car 
he's driving is not his . He seldom , if ever , 
goes to the movies . He seldom , if ever , goes 
to the movies . I often listened to him speak in English 
. I heard him coming downstairs . We don't care what he 
does . Guess what he told me . What do you think 
he did ? Do you know what he has done ? I 
don't care what he does . There is no telling what he 
will do . No matter what he says , don't trust him 
. Can you make out what he is trying to say ? 
No matter what he may say , don't trust him . Do 
you know what he said ? What do you think he has 
in mind ? There is no telling what he is thinking . 
There is no telling what he is thinking . I can't imagine 
what he is thinking . I don't mind in the slightest who 
he is . I don't mind in the slightest who he is 
. He broke into a house . He had hardly left home 
when it began to rain . I never heard him sing . 
He sang a song . He is commander of our troops . 
I expect that he will help us . I wish he had 
attended the meeting . Everyone knows that he worked hard to get 
to the top of the company . I had hoped that he 
would recover . Is there any prospect of his recovering ? There 
is no hope of his recovery . It is this window that 
he broke . It's true that he saw a monster . We 
heard him come downstairs . I heard him go down the stairs 
. Did you see him go out ? He can not have 
gone to school . He can't have gone to school . It 
was a glass that he broke . He is the minister responsible 
for the environment . It is plain that he is wrong . 
Look at the book which he put on the desk . I 
remember the time when he returned . Will you tell him about 
it when he comes home ? Let's start after he comes home 
. Please wait till he comes back . Let's leave things as 
they are until he comes back . I'll wait here till he 
comes back . Let's leave as soon as he gets back . 
He was elected chairman . After he left , she started feeling 
uneasy . I stayed there until he had left . He was 
right to give up smoking . He moved into my neighborhood . 
We congratulated him on winning a gold medal . I caught him 
stealing the money . I never counted on his being rich . 
The police suspect that he robbed the bank . I am convinced 
that he is innocent . They have been married for ten years 
. It was a miracle that he recovered . He was seen 
to enter the building . The box he found was empty . 
I'm sure that he is clever . We were talking about him 
when he appeared . His appearance animated the party . His appearance 
animated the party . I have no idea where he is at 
present . All that he says is true . What he says 
is false . What he says is very important . Few students 
could understand what he said . What he said turned out to 
be false . What he said cannot be true . What he 
said may well be true . What he said is not true 
. What he said turned out to be true . Do you 
believe what he said ? I remember what he said . Everything 
he said was right . I got the gist of what he 
was saying . What he is saying doesn't make sense . What 
he says sounds very sensible to me . I like him . 
The dog followed him wherever he went . I don't care whether 
he leaves or stays . I don't care whether he leaves or 
stays . It is doubtful whether he will pass . I copied 
in my notebook whatever he wrote on the blackboard . I wish 
he were here now . We are worried about where he is 
now . It is certain that he is in Hawaii now . 
Where he will live doesn't interest us . We were surprised when 
we saw him in the office this morning . I am uncertain 
when he will come next . I don't know if he will 
visit us next Sunday . You should read such a good book 
as he is reading now . What he is today he owes 
to his father . I don't know the reason he is absent 
today . Do you know the reason why he cut class today 
? It is no laughing matter that he couldn't graduate from university 
this year . It is no laughing matter that he couldn't graduate 
from university this year . The dinner he ate this evening was 
inferior in quality to that dinner . His reelection seems sure . 
What he needs most is a good job . It serves him 
right that he missed the last train . He was the first 
to arrive . He was the first person to arrive . He 
was the first to come . His boast that he is the 
best pitcher is true . There is no doubt about his ability 
. There is no room to doubt that he is a gifted 
artist . I must make sure whether he is at home or 
not . The model plane they built was fragile . The fish 
he caught yesterday is still alive . He came to see you 
yesterday . What he said yesterday is not consistent with what he 
had said last week . What he said yesterday is not true 
. I don't care whether he agrees or not . I am 
certain that he will quit his job . He has every reason 
to quit his job . He is certain to turn up . 
Let's wait here until he turns up . I've known him ever 
since he was a child . He is actually not the manager 
. I was surprised at the news of his death . It 
was yesterday that he died . It was yesterday that he died 
. The evening he died was stormy . He has been dead 
for three years . She still hated him , even after he 
died . Ten years have passed since he died . He has 
been dead for five years . Three years have passed since he 
died . I don't know whether he will join us or not 
. I wish he were on our team . He is the 
chief of my department . He went in place of me . 
If he had taken my advice , he would now be rich 
. He went into the water before me . I saw him 
looking at me . I know he is watching me . He 
came to my rescue . I expected that he would visit me 
. I'm glad that he passed the exam . He is certain 
to win the game . It was pure chance that he won 
the game . I question whether he'll come in time . I 
doubt if he will come on time . You can rely upon 
his being punctual . You cannot calculate on his punctuality . There 
is not much possibility of his coming on time . What he 
did next was quite a surprise to me . There is no 
knowing what he will do next . His next two books were 
novels . He was passing by on his bicycle when he heard 
a cry for help . It took him three months to learn 
to ride a bicycle . I am very much surprised to hear 
that he got badly injured in a motorcar accident . He can't 
possibly write the letter by himself . There is a picture of 
his own painting . The woman who he thought was his aunt 
was a stranger . That was all he needed to operate his 
computer . It looked almost impossible for him to finish his book 
. He may well be proud of his daughter . It is 
certain that he helped them for the benefit of himself . There 
is a rumor that he has resigned . There is no reason 
why he should resign . There is no reason why he should 
resign . There are rumors that he will resign . There is 
a rumor about that he is going to resign . I didn't 
know he had decided to leave his job . It is not 
surprising that he resigned . Because he was unemployed , their wedlock 
failed . I was surprised that he had failed . It is 
no wonder that he failed . His failure was due to his 
idleness . It is no wonder that he has failed . I 
am afraid he will make a mistake . That he will fail 
is certain . It is hardly conceivable to me that he will 
fail . I expect him to get over the shock of his 
failure . The ease with which he answered the question surprised us 
. I found it impossible to explain what he is really like 
. The photo he showed added color to his story . He 
kindly drove me to the station . I saw him wash the 
car . He guaranteed my debt . Tell me the reason why 
he was fired . Is there any possibility of his resigning ? 
I am positive that he has finished . The place where he 
lives is far from town . Do you know the town where 
he lives ? As soon as he went out , it began 
to rain . I heard him go out . As soon as 
he left , the bank closed . I don't doubt that he 
will help me . We took it for granted that he would 
help us . There is a good chance that he will win 
. There is a good chance that he will win . There 
is little chance of his winning . I took it for granted 
that he would consent . It is important for him to get 
the job . He said he would pay for the dinner . 
I can assure you of his reliability . He can't know the 
truth . You shouldn't let him get away with cheating . He 
owes his success to good luck . His success depends on his 
efforts . I hope that he will succeed . I hope that 
he will succeed . That he will succeed is certain . He 
couldn't possibly succeed . There is very little hope of his success 
. I admit that he is right . I am of the 
opinion that he is right . I don't know exactly when he 
will arrive . I doubt if he is honest . I found 
him honest . His honesty is beyond doubt . I would never 
question his honesty . Her honesty is beyond question . He can't 
be an honest man . I was relieved to hear that he 
was alive . I don't know whether he is dead or alive 
. There is no hope of his being alive . Where was 
he born and raised ? He brings home the bread and butter 
. Is there any possibility that he'll win the election ? Is 
there any possibility that he'll win the election ? It's unusual for 
him to get up early . I believe him to get up 
early . I saw him running . He's every reason to be 
proud of his son . I've never heard him speak ill of 
others . It is clear that he has made a big mistake 
. He acted like he owned the place . I really like 
him ! He sent me a birthday card . If only he 
had known ! Give him this message the moment he arrives . 
I'll give him this message the moment he arrives . Let's leave 
as soon as he arrives . That he grew up in China 
is well-known . We saw him walking across the street . We 
saw him walk across the street . I saw him enter the 
store . He must have missed the train . Ten years have 
passed since he went to America . Ten years have passed since 
he went to America . The crowd cheered when he appeared . 
I caught him by the arm before he could fall . There 
is no need for him to work . He was seen crossing 
the road . The crowd yelled when he scored a goal . 
He did the work on his own . His sudden appearance surprised 
us all . He has been in Japan for three years . 
It has been three months since he left Japan . It has 
been ten years since he left Japan . I had been reading 
for an hour when he came in . I had been reading 
a book for about an hour when he came in . Did 
you notice him coming in ? It was dark when he came 
in . I had been studying English for two hours when he 
came in . I had been reading a book when he came 
in . It is true that he went bankrupt . The first 
item he bought was an alarm clock . He deserves punishment . 
He is in charge of the sales department . He or I 
am to blame . It was cruel of him to say such 
things to her . We couldn't stop him from hitting her . 
No one knows whether he loves her or not . It was 
obvious to everybody that he was tired . It's a miracle he 
wasn't killed in the plane crash . Look at the picture which 
he painted . He can't have been ill . He can't be 
ill . You ought to have known that he was sick in 
bed . He is managing the business for his father . I 
noticed him sneak into the room . He burst into the room 
. I heard him go out of the room . I didn't 
know he had decided to leave . We had known him for 
five years when he died . His death was partly my fault 
. They say that he has been dead for two years . 
I know he is busy . I know that he was busy 
. That he was busy is true . All he wanted was 
time to finish his painting . He put the idea into my 
head . He had been reading for two hours when she came 
in . I can't figure out what he really wants . A 
burglar broke in while he was asleep . I was relieved to 
hear that he was safe . No one believes that he is 
innocent . I saw him sawing a tree . Let's wait until 
he wakes up . Give him the message when he comes back 
. I will tell him so when he comes back . How 
about waiting here until he gets back ? Wait here till he 
comes back . I will finish it by the time he comes 
back . I will wait here until he comes back . Let's 
wait till he comes back . What do you think made him 
break his promise ? It is doubtful whether he will keep his 
word . It wasn't easy for him to keep his promise . 
It wasn't easy for him to keep his promise . He is 
likely to win the championship . The reason which he gave is 
hard to understand . I was taking a bath when he came 
. I had written the letter when he came . We will 
leave as soon as he comes . Let's start as soon as 
he comes . I'll tell him so when he comes . Let's 
do it when he comes . Will you let me know when 
he comes ? Ask him about it when he comes . I 
expected that he would come . I bet five dollars that he 
will not come . If he doesn't come , we won't go 
. Whether he comes or not , I'll go . It is 
doubtful whether he will come or not . I doubt if he 
will come . I don't know whether he will come or not 
. I don't know whether he will come or not . I 
am doubtful whether he will come . There's no possibility of his 
coming . You had better be ready in case he comes . 
I will wait here till he comes . Let's wait till he 
comes . Is there any likelihood of his coming ? His disappointment 
was obvious to everyone . There is no denying that he is

some day . Are they coming as well ? Don't make fun 
of them . It is our duty to help them . He 
gave me authority to fire them . There's no need to see 
them off . Will you help them ? Let them come in 
. They love each other . They died one after another . 
They are very compatible . If you flatter him , he'll do 
anything . You should not make fun of him . I can't 
help making fun of him . Did you know him ? Let's 
call him Snoopy . Don't blame him for the error . Have 
him wait a moment . I must help him . I feel 
like telling him what I think of him . Don't stop him 
. Quiet him down , will you ? I planned to introduce 
him to Beatrice . Keep a close eye on him . It 
is incumbent on us to support him . I managed to bring 
him around to my way of thinking . I can't pretend to 
like him . I couldn't help feeling sorry for him . Let's 
receive him with a happy smile . We did not move for 
fear we should wake him up . It never occurred to me 
to doubt him . You may call him a fool , but 
you cannot call him a coward . I saw him off at 
the airport . We gave him a royal send-off at the airport 
. You'd better not make light of him . I could not 
help laughing when I saw him . As soon as I saw 
him , I burst into laughter . The instant I saw him 
I knew he was angry . I don't see him . Look 
at him . He's drunk again . The moment I saw him 
, I knew he was angry . He reminds me of my 
grandfather . I have been to the airport to see him off 
. Keep watch on him . Can any girl like him ? 
What's the accusation against him ? I made believe that I supported 
him . We thought it impossible to stop him . Follow his 
example . He shall be fired . Outside of him , no 
one else came to the party . I feel kind of sorry 
for him . You ought to have invited him , but you 
didn't. There was no one who did not admire him . It 
makes him a laughingstock . It was stupid of you to believe 
in him . It is stupid of you to believe in him 
. You should have known better than to trust him . You 
ought not to believe him . You can't trust him . You 
should not trust him . Don't trust him . I don't see 
any point in persuading him . I figure that there is no 
point in trying to persuade him . I wish I could have 
persuaded him to join us . It is no use trying to 
persuade him . There's no use trying to persuade him . You're 
the only person that can persuade him . We found it impossible 
to persuade him . We have no trust in him . All 
we can do is wait for him . All we can do 
is to wait for him . Do I know him ? Show 
him in . Bring him in . Give him time . Don't 
make an enemy of him . Would you mind calling him to 
the phone ? Try not to make him angry . You must 
not shout at him . You can rely upon him . Don't 
make a fool of him . You can't mistake him for his 
younger brother . It was wise of you to keep away from 
him . His repeated delinquencies brought him to court . I am 
far from blaming him . You take him to the hospital . 
Could I ask you to drive him to the hospital ? I 
spoke to him kindly so as not to frighten him . I 
doubt if he is a lawyer . They buried him in his 
grave . I can't let him alone . When I called on 
him , he was not at home . I was welcomed whenever 
I visited him . I expected that I would visit him , 
but I couldn't. It's hard to please him . Don't arouse him 
from his sleep ! He reported fully what he had seen to 
the police . There wasn't enough evidence to convict him of the 
crime . Nobody ever praises him . He himself said so . 
He himself did it . She has a husband and two daughters 
. Who do you think she is ? There's no way she'll 
ever marry Sato . She is able to speak ten languages . 
She is leading by two meters . She can't be over thirty 
; she must still be in her twenties . She may well 
refuse to speak to you because she's in a very bad mood 
. She may well refuse to speak to you because she's in 
a very bad mood . Is she your teacher ? There is 
no reason for her to scold you . I took her for 
an American . She gave me some good advice . Do you 
know when she will come ? I miss her so much . 
She cannot have told a lie . I was angry that she 
had deceived my children . She played the guitar and he sang 
. I'm sorry she's not here . I saw her coming up 
the road . She will show you around this town . Everybody 
knew that she was being pushy . She will soon clear away 
these dishes . I hope that she'll get well soon . She 
can't have said so . She came out of there . It 
was a camera that she bought there . That she was there 
is certain . By the time she gets there , it will 
be nearly dark . By the time you get out of prison 
, she'll have been married . She reported the news . She 
can't have done such a thing . She can not have said 
such a thing . I often heard her sing that song . 
It took a whole day to paint the picture . Nobody knows 
what has become of her . She looked after the child . 
Great was her surprise when she knew the fact . I thought 
it difficult for her to get the ticket . Seeing that she 
was not excited at the news , she must have known it 
. She may have been surprised when she heard the news . 
She may well be beside herself with joy at the news . 
No one doubts her fitness for the post . It will take 
her at least two years to be qualified for that post . 
She bought a book at the shop . Her implication in the 
crime was obvious . It is strange that she should do such 
a thing . She cannot have done such a thing . I 
am surprised that she refused such a good offer . She can't 
have said such a thing . I wish that she would stop 
smoking . Do you know who she is ? She was just 
about to take a bath when the bell rang . She will 
clear the table of the dishes . Hardly had she opened the 
door when a white dog rushed out of the house . Hardly 
had she opened the door when a white dog rushed out of 
the house . Do you know where he was born ? I 
know where she is . Do you know where she is ? 
No one could tell where she was . Tell me where she 
lives . It beats me where she's gone . I did not 
notice how glad she was . I wonder why she is so 
worried . I know the reason that she quit her job . 
It is still a mystery why she killed herself . Do you 
remember what she said ? She cannot have seen me at the 
party . Few people noticed her absence from the party . It's 
too bad she can't come to the party . Her debut was 
the biggest social event of the season . I noticed her the 
moment she got off the bus . The day she started for 
Paris was rainy . She will accompany me on the piano . 
I saw her play the piano . She was playing the piano 
when the guests arrived . I often hear her play the piano 
. Have you ever heard her play the piano ? She seldom 
, if ever , goes to movies by herself . I don't 
know whether she likes her coffee black . It is true that 
she teaches French . I don't know if she will go there 
with me . I was annoyed that she was still asleep . 
I find it strange that she hasn't arrived yet . He asked 
me whether she was coming . She was ready to jump ship 
. I want to get the book back from her . I 
hear from her once in a while . I found her letter 
in the mailbox . I am expecting a letter from her . 
Her answer couldn't be understood . She sent you her best wishes 
. I have not heard from her for a month . I 
had a call from her for the first time in a long 
time . I had a telephone call from her . Have you 
heard from her ? She brought apples , oranges , and so 
on . She brought apples , oranges , and so on . 
It took a long time for her to write the report . 
I was amazed that she had drunk all of the wine . 
She broke into tears . She loves Tom , not me . 
It's you that she loves , not me . She acted as 
a guide . Everybody knew she could speak English well . Have 
you heard her speaking English ? Do you know whether she can 
speak English ? Do you know what she said ? It was 
not clear what she said . Ask her what she has done 
. I had no idea of what she intended to do . 
It wasn't clear what she meant . It makes no difference what 
she said . Ask her what she bought . I found out 
where she was . Ask him whether she is at home or 
not . I assisted her in moving the furniture . Can you 
hear her singing ? I heard her singing . She took part 
in our project . There is little hope of her recovery . 
I caught sight of her as she turned the corner . She 
was heard to criticize the manager . He will tell her about 
it when she comes back . Should I wait for her to 
come back ? I will be gone by the time she comes 
back . I feel sorry for her . It is quite natural 
for her to get angry . We heard her cry . She 
is very anxious about your health . I was not aware of 
her absence . I believe beyond doubt that she is innocent . 
There is a rumor that she got married . I heard from 
someone that she got married . What age was she when she 
got married ? I don't doubt that she is married . I 
didn't know she was married . The box she found was empty 
. I don't know whether she will show up . What she 
says may be true . What she said wasn't true . I 
can't make out what she is saying . Her look says that 
she loves you . It's not fair that she can go and 
I can't. I wish she were alive now . I could tell 
at a glance that she was in trouble . What she liked 
best was herring roe . She was the last to cross the 
finishing line . It is over ten years since she last went 
back to her country . To my amazement she came first . 
We must take into account the fact that she is old . 
It doesn't matter whether she admits her guilt or not . Her 
ability to amass a fortune is due to luck and hard work 
. I tasted the cake she cooked . What she told me 
yesterday is a white lie . I wish she had come last 
night . All she got for her pains was ingratitude . Whether 
she will agree or not is not clear . Whether she agrees 
or not is the question . She is certain to turn up 
. I have known her since she was a little girl . 
Given her interest in children , I am sure teaching is the 
right career for her . I often hear her refer to her 
childhood . Everyone can tell she is thoughtful . Who broke the 
news of her death to you ? The rumor of her death 
turned out false . The news that she died is false . 
She has been dead five years . She has been dead five 
years . She has been dead for ten years . She has 
been dead for ten years . Her deathly paleness is due to 
long illness . French is taught us by her . I never 
expected that she would join us . I don't know if she 
wants to go with me . She gave me this compact disc 
. He asked me whether she had given me the book , 
or if I had bought it myself . She taught me how 
to make a web site . It is doubtful whether she will 
come to see me . She came up to me and said 
" How are you ? " She sent me a postcard that 
said she hates the smell of animals . I took it for 
granted that she would agree with me . She smiled at me 
. I couldn't think who she was when she spoke to me 
. I'd rather she sat next to me . She cannot have 
forgotten my address . I had her sweep my room . I 
can't believe that she is older than my mother . I can't 
conceive of her deceiving me . She may be our teacher . 
It is doubtful whether she will come on time . She can't 
have written it herself . She is no match for me . 
She held out her hand and I shook it . She stands 
a good chance of winning the prize . Her first appearance on 
the stage was in 1969. She came to my aid . She 
is apt to win the prize . She cannot have gone to 
bed yet . I am of the opinion that she is right 
. I am of the opinion that she is right . It 
worried me that she looked pale . She's going to be in 
charge . I hope that she will get well soon . I've 
never heard her speak ill of others . I heard her calling 
from the kitchen . Didn't you notice that she was very excited 
? She rarely , if ever , goes out of town . 
I saw her coming across the street . Please tell me the 
reason why she got angry . I'll let you know when she 
arrives . I'm glad to hear that she is unmarried . What 
she bought was very expensive . He arrived the day she left 
. She has been married to him for a decade now . 
She is his present wife . She cannot have turned down his 
offer . I couldn't understand why she frowned at him . She 
accompanied me to the hospital . She has been sick for a 
week . I saw her leaving the room . I could hear 
her sobbing in her bedroom . She came into the room . 
Why was it that she got angry ? The doctor she visited 
is famous . She gave me a present . She drives me 
mad . I know she is sleeping . I'll have her call 
you when she gets back . I'll leave when she comes back 
. Let's wait here until she comes back . I am angry 
that she didn't keep her promise . She cannot have broken her 
promise . He predicted she would win . Give her this letter 
when she comes . As soon as she comes , we will 
begin . He was going to leave the house when she came 
. I had almost finished my work when she came . I 
don't know the reason why she isn't coming . It is doubtful 
whether she will come . I don't know if she will come 
. I don't know whether she will come . I will go 
provided that she comes . I will wait until she comes . 
She didn't need to come . I had to grab her to 
keep her from falling . I remember that she wore a green 
hat . She is first in line . He interrupted her while 
she was speaking . The more she talked , the more bored 
I got . She is old enough to know better than to 
expect too much of her parents . She just blew it off 
. She soon adjusted herself to the new school . She's smartly 
dressed . Her speech was excellent . Do you remember what she 
was like ? They sang in chorus . We didn't stay home 
yesterday . She gave us lots to eat . I'm getting married 
to her in June . She opened the door . I wish 
I could have gone with her . I am looking forward to 
seeing the film with her . I generally agree with her . 
Do you ever date her ? I enjoyed talking with her . 
I began a meeting with her . She and I usually agree 
. What relation is she to you ? Do you see her 
often ? I haven't met her . She is more an acquaintance 
than a friend . I feel comfortable in her company . I 
don't feel at home in her company . She is amusing to 
be with . You will never get bored in her company . 
I am sorry that I could not go with her . Will 
you meet her ? It is no use arguing with her . 
I bump into her . Whoever wants to marry her must first 
convince her father . I had known her for ten years when 
I married her . Tell me the reason why you married her 
. I wish I had got married to her . I will 
be able to marry her . I will be able to marry 
her . I couldn't make her out at all . I have 
nothing in common with her . She and I are in the 
same class . It happened that she and I liked the same 
kind of music . She and I get on well . I 
exchanged seats with her . I struck up an acquaintance with her 
. It was pure accident that I came to know her . 
How long have you known her ? I am friendly with her 
. I made up with her . I tried to keep in 
with her in vain . I met up with her on the 
street . I speak French as well as she does . Can 
you distinguish her from her sister ? I got together with her 
mainly because we seemed to share the same feelings about things . 
I can't stand losing her . You should watch your language when 
you talk to her . I am fed up with talking to 
her . She is a student from Canada , staying with my 
uncle . She will cope with all the work . She deserves 
to succeed . She married to the kind of man you would 
expect her to pick . I have an acquaintance with her . 
I owe ten dollars to her . Shall I send a few 
books for her ? I am sure I saw her two years 
ago . I have seen her three times . My heart beats 
fast each time I see her . I saw her only a 
week ago . I remember telling her that news . She seems 
to have found a boyfriend . I tried to give her some 
money , but she would not take any . She shall serve 
tea . To kiss her is one thing , and to love 
is another . I motioned to her not to smoke . It 
is true that I was head over heels in love with her 
. Please give my best thanks to her . Give her these 
roses , and she will be pleased . I would like to 
thank you in advance for any help that you are able to 
give her . I don't want to be the one who breaks 
the news to her . Shall I ask her to send the 
book to us ? It is impossible to make her understand the 
theory . I don't feel like telling her about it . You 
shouldn't have told her such a thing . It's rude of you 
to ask her that question . She fooled me into giving her 
the money . All sorts of rumors rose about her past . 
I know nothing about her except that she is a pianist . 
I know nothing about her . Where did you see her ? 
Nothing is more precious to her than the brooch . She values 
health above wealth . It seems to be difficult for her to 
get along with students in the new school . Nothing gave her 
greater pleasure than to watch her son growing up . Ask her 
how much soup she wants . She appears to have few friends 
. I'm fed up with her . She appears to have many 
friends . She badly needed the money . There's something mysterious about 
her . She has a marvelous sense of humor . I still 
have some feelings for her . She has a daughter whose name 
is Mary . She has a lot of work to do . 
She has a son who is a doctor . There was something 
strange about her . I remember meeting her somewhere . I haven't 
seen her in years . She didn't want to get involved . 
She has a brilliant future . She has no sense of duty 
. She has an uncle who works in a bank . She 
has no brothers . I like her none the less for her 
faults . She has faults , too . She has five older 
brothers . She had no idea what I said . She needed 
someone who would understand her . She is lacking in common sense 
. She is carefree . She had enough wisdom to refuse the 
offer . She has very few close friends . She has a 
son , who became a doctor . She has many faults . 
She has a son and two daughters . She doesn't have any 
enemies . She has a daughter who is tall . She has 
some literary talent . She has a distinct English accent . She 
appears to have a lot of friends . She has a few 
friends . She had no one to turn to . She has 
no one to turn to . She had good reason to file 
for a divorce . She has no one to speak to . 
I am ashamed of having been rude to her . Will you 
introduce me to her ? She has seen better days . Please 
say hello to her . I was writing her a love letter 
. I remember seeing her before . Why don't you drop her 
a line ? I wonder what has happened to her . I 
wonder what happened to her . Ask her when she will come 
back . I must remember to see her . You'll find it 
difficult to meet her . It is difficult to see her . 
I wish I had seen her . I regret missing the chance 
to meet her . I am excited at the prospect of seeing 
her . I had never seen her . I'll never forget seeing 
her . I'm going to propose to her . She had no

can search words , and get translations . But it's not exactly 
a typical dictionary . It's all about sentences . Not words . 
Why sentences ? …you may ask . Well , because sentences are 
more interesting . Why sentences ? …you may ask . Well , 
because sentences are more interesting . Sentences bring context to the words 
. Sentences have personalities . They can be funny , smart , 
silly , insightful , touching , hurtful . Sentences can teach us 
a lot . And a lot more than just words . So 
we love sentences . But , even more , we love languages 
. And what we really want is to have many sentences in 
many — and any — languages . This is why Tatoeba is 
multilingual . But not that kind of multilingual . Not the kind 
where languages are simply being paired up together , and where some 
pairs are left behind . Tatoeba is really multilingual . All the 
languages are interconnected . If an Icelandic sentence has a translation in 
English , and the English sentence has a translation in Swahili , 
then indirectly , this will provide a Swahili translation for the Icelandic 
sentence . If an Icelandic sentence has a translation in English , 
and the English sentence has a translation in Swahili , then indirectly 
, this will provide a Swahili translation for the Icelandic sentence . 
Languages that would have never found themselves together in a traditional system 
, can be connected in Tatoeba . But where do we get 
those sentences ? And how do we translate them ? Obviously , 
this cannot be the work of one person . This is why 
Tatoeba is collaborative . Everyone is free to contribute . Everyone is 
free to contribute . Everyone is free to contribute . And everyone 
has the ability to contribute . It doesn't require you to be 
a polyglot . It doesn't require you to be a polyglot . 
It doesn't require you to be a polyglot . Everyone speaks a 
language . Everyone can feed the database to illustrate new vocabulary . 
Everyone can help ensure that sentences sound correct , and are correctly 
spelled . And actually , this project needs everyone . Languages are 
not carved in stone . Languages live through all of us . 
We want to capture all the uniqueness of each language . And 
we as well want to capture their evolution through time . But 
you know , it would be sad to collect all these sentences 
, and keep them for ourselves . Because there's so much you 
can do with them . Which is why Tatoeba is open . 
Our source code is open . Our data is open . We're 
releasing all the sentences we collect under the Creative Commons Attribution license 
. This means you can reuse them freely for a textbook , 
for an application , for a research project , for anything ! 
So that's Tatoeba . But that's not the whole picture . Tatoeba 
is not just an open , collaborative , multilingual dictionary of sentences 
. It's part of an ecosystem that we want to build . 
We want to bring language tools to the next level . We 
want to see innovation in the language learning landscape . And this 
cannot happen without open language resources which cannot be built without a 
community which cannot contribute without efficient platforms . So ultimately , with 
Tatoeba we are only building the foundations … to make the Web 
a better place for language learning . It's a hard question .

multitasking kernels . Almost all implementations of virtual memory divide the virtual 
address space of an application program into pages ; a page is 
a block of contiguous virtual memory addresses . Pages are usually at 
least 4 KiB ( 4×1024 bytes ) in size , and systems 
with large virtual address ranges or large amounts of real memory generally 
use larger page sizes . By 1969 the debate over virtual memory 
for commercial computers was over . An IBM research team led by 
David Sayre showed that their virtual memory overlay system consistently worked better 
than the best manually controlled systems . Some systems , such as 
Burroughs B5500 , do not use paging to implement virtual memory . 
Instead , they use segmentation , that divide virtual address spaces into 
variable - length segments . A virtual address consists of a segment 
number and an offset within the segment . I took a walk

eat . I've figured out the puzzle . I've got really good 
news . I've got so much left to do . I've had 
a really tough day . I've had no problems with my boss

you sound like a native speaker , it means they probably noticed 
something about your speaking that made them realize you weren't a native 
speaker . In other words , you don't really sound like a 
native speaker . If you don't mind , may we inspect your 
suitcase ? If you need my help , all you have to 
do is ask . If you want to come for a visit 
, please do . If you want to sound like a native 
speaker , you must be willing to practice saying the same sentence 
over and over in the same way that banjo players practice the

like a native speaker . Instead of eating real food , we 
just ate junk food all day . Instead of eating vegetables , 
he puts them in a blender and drinks them . Is eating

every day beneficial to your health ? Is eating between meals really 
bad for your health ? Is eating cockroaches a bad idea ?

the weather . It looks like we'd better leave . It looks 
like we're running out of money . It looks like we're running 
out of water . It looks like we're staying here tonight .

run out of gasoline and started walking . To the best of 
my knowledge , Tom can't swim . Three months before Tom was 
to graduate from college , he died . Though Tom's English seems 
quite good at times , he doesn't seem to know his limitations 
and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes 
a mistake . Those are Tom's dogs . This land belongs to 
Tom . This just has to be Tom's hat . This is

belong to Tom . These shoes are Tom's. These gloves belong to 
Tom . These gloves are Tom's. There was something odd about the 
way Tom looked at me yesterday . There's something about Tom that 
I don't like . There's something about Tom that gets on my 
nerves . There's nothing I could ever say that would make Tom 
change his mind . There's nothing I could ever say that would 
make Tom change his mind . There's no way that Tom could 
have stolen the money without being seen . There's no doubt that 
Tom used to live in Boston . There's a possibility that Tom 
will be late . There were many things that Tom wanted to 
do before he died . There was some mud on Tom's boots 
. There was a limousine waiting for Tom outside the hotel . 
There is indisputable proof that Tom is the thief . There have 
been a lot of complaints about the way Tom behaves . There 
aren't any signs that Tom has been here . There are many 
talented people in our city , but Tom isn't one of them 
. The workers at Tom's company are demanding shorter working hours . 
The waitress flirted with Tom thinking that he'd leave her a larger

desk is Tom's. The DA wants me to testify against Tom . 
The bartender threw Tom out of the bar . The background check 
on Tom turned up suspiciously little . That's just the way Tom 
is . That tall building across the street is where Tom works 
. That house over there is where Tom lives . That day 
, Tom bought as many cameras as he could afford . That 
camera is Tom's most prized possession . Tell Tom that he can 
get in touch with me at home this evening . Tell me 
something about Tom . Some object to Tom's opinion . Since Tom 
is leaving for Boston tomorrow , today is our last chance to 
give this to him . Since the accident , Tom has given 
up hope of becoming a professional dancer . Since it was getting 
even hotter , Tom peeled off another layer of clothing . Please 
write down what Tom says . Please wait till 2:30. Tom will 
back then . Please tell Tom to wait . Please tell Tom 
that I called . Please say hello to Tom for me . 
Please remember what Tom said . Please have Tom wait until I 
get there . Please ask Tom to come here and help us 
fill out these forms . Please ask Tom to call me before 
2:30. Perhaps Tom can solve this problem . Part of what Tom 
said was true . Only Tom would have the guts to do 
that kind of thing . Now that you mention it , I 
don't remember seeing Tom in class today . Not knowing what to 
expect , Tom was caught off guard . Nobody saw Tom steal 
the book . Nobody saw Tom leave the room . Nobody saw 
Tom do it . Nobody noticed Tom leave the room . Nobody 
knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money 
. No one laughed at Tom's jokes . No matter how much 
Tom eats , he wants to eat more . My most interesting 
Canadian friend is Tom . Maybe you need to be reminded how 
dangerous Tom is . Luckily , Tom made some sound investments . 
Like Tom said , this is a waste of time . Like 
many students at our school , Tom stays up until late at 
night studying . Like many other students , Tom rides a bicycle 
to school . Let's split up and look for Tom . Let's 
not start drinking until Tom gets here . Let Tom do that 
by himself . Let me tell you why I don't like Tom 
. Leave Tom alone . Keep a close eye on Tom and 
make sure he doesn't get into any trouble . It's very unlikely 
that Tom's children inherited anything from him . It's very unlikely that 
Tom wrote this report . It's very unlikely that Tom will ever 
want to travel alone . It's very unlikely that Tom will be 
fired . It's very unlikely that Tom will agree to work for 
that salary . It's very unlikely that Tom survived the crash . 
It's very unlikely that Tom acts that way at home . It's 
very unlikely that the teacher will believe Tom's excuse for not having 
his homework done on time . It's very unlikely that any evidence 
will turn up to prove Tom's guilt . It's unlikely that Tom 
will get out of prison anytime soon . It's unlikely that Tom 
will ever return home . It's unlikely that Tom will ever learn 
to play the mandolin . It's unlikely that Tom will attend the 
meeting . It's unlikely that the boss would consider giving Tom a 
raise . It's unlikely that anyone other than Tom would be interested 
in buying this . It's unlikely that anyone besides Tom would consider 
taking that job . It's OK with me if Tom watches television 
after he finishes his homework . It's been three years since Tom 
left Boston . It's been three years since Tom has been to 
visit us . It's because of you that Tom decided to go 
home early . It's amazing how much trouble Tom is able to 
get into . It's amazing how much time it takes Tom to 
wash his car . It's amazing how much money Tom spends every 
week . It's amazing how little time Tom spends with his children 
. It's all Tom's fault . It was late at night when 
Tom finally got home . It was definitely Tom that I saw 
yesterday in the park . It turns out that Tom never graduated 
from college . It took Tom a few weeks to get used 
to working in his new office . It seems that Tom can't 
swim . It seemed that Tom wanted to attend the party . 
It may seem obvious to Tom , but it doesn't seem obvious 
to me . It may seem like Tom has forgotten all about 
the matter , but deep down inside , he's still torn up 
about it . It may seem like just a little thing to 
you , but Tom is really worried about the whole thing . 
It looks like Tom will eat the whole thing . It looks 
like Tom is sleepy . It looks like Tom is mad . 
It looks like Tom has gained a little weight . It doesn't 
make much sense to me , but Tom has decided not to 
go to college . It doesn't make any difference to me whether 
Tom comes or not . It can't hurt for you to spend 
a little time with Tom . Isn't Tom forgetting something ? Isn't 
it strange that Tom isn't here by now ? Is Tom seriously 
thinking about not going to today's meeting ? Is this Tom's bag 
? In the early afternoon , Tom decided that he just had 
to get out of the house . In retrospect , Tom wishes 
he had spent more time studying . In retrospect , Tom realized 
he shouldn't have been dating both sisters at the same time . 
In his heart , Tom knew that he would never return . 
If you ever do anything to hurt Tom , I'll kill you 
. If Tom's girlfriend knew he was here now , she'd be 
very angry . If Tom does that , he's sure to regret 
it . If only I'd listened to what Tom said , I 
wouldn't be in this kind of trouble . If I remember correctly 
, Tom used to be a carpenter . I've seen Tom on 
TV many times . I've never known Tom to break a promise 
. I've made up my mind to ask Tom to forgive me 
. I've heard that Tom can cook as well as , or 
better than , his wife . I've had no problems with Tom 
. I've figured out why Tom is always late . I've figured 
out that the only way I can do this is to get 
Tom to help me . I'm the only person Tom knows who 
can play chess . I'm the only person Tom knows in this 
town . I'm sure that Tom would want you to go . 
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't eat all his dinner . I'll 
do whatever I have to do to put Tom behind bars . 
I wonder why Tom didn't show up last night . I wonder 
who will help Tom decorate the Christmas tree . I wonder when 
Tom will get here . I wonder what Tom thinks of me 
. I wonder what Tom ate for his Christmas dinner . I 
wonder if we'll have enough money to buy Tom the painting he 
wanted . I wonder if Tom will get here on time . 
I wonder if Tom regrets what he did . I wonder if 
Tom realizes how lonely I am . I wonder if Tom misses 
me when I'm gone . I wonder if Tom has ever slept 
on a park bench . I wonder if Tom ever works on 
Sunday . I wonder if Tom ever cries . I wish you 
would stop calling me Tom . I wish you would start calling 
me Tom . I wish Tom wouldn't keep hassling me . I 
wish Tom wouldn't keep bothering me . I wish Tom wouldn't do 
that kind of thing . I wish Tom wouldn't always be late 
. I wish Tom would weed the garden . I wish Tom 
would help me weed the garden . I wish Tom would help 
me move the sofa . I wish Tom were here . I 
wish I hadn't punched Tom in the nose . I wish I 
had as much money as Tom . I wish I had as 
much energy as Tom . I wish I had a butler like 
Tom . I wish I could figure out how to make Tom 
happy . I was surprised to get a call from Tom .

that Tom hasn't left yet . I think it's unlikely that Tom 
would ever move . I think it's unlikely that Tom will get 
elected . I think it's unlikely that Tom will be arrested . 
I suspect that Tom is a cold-blooded murderer . I shouldn't have 
kissed Tom . I shouldn't have gone to see Tom . I 
should've listened to Tom's advice . I saw Tom standing near the 
exit . I saw Tom on the stairs . I saw Tom 
a while back . I realized too late that I needed Tom's 
help . I paid Tom one hundred dollars . I never knew 
Tom's mother was Japanese . I met a young man whose name 
was Tom . I like the kind of music Tom composes . 
I honestly didn't think Tom would show up . I heard that

? I heard that Tom had been smuggling drugs into America for 
years before he got caught . I heard a strange noise coming 
from Tom's room last night . I hear that Tom isn't in 
Boston now . I have no doubt in my mind that Tom 
will show up at the auction . I had no idea that

project . I doubt that Tom meant any harm . I doubt 
that Tom is innocent . I doubt that Tom is happy .

be done . I doubt that Tom has the courage to cross 
the picket line . I doubt that Tom has finished his homework 
. I doubt that Tom had to sell his car in order

to work right now . I don't think Tom can deal with

help , Mary would have failed . Without Tom's advice , Mary 
would have failed . Without Tom , Mary would have no one 
to turn to . Why would Tom want to kill Mary ?

first time Tom had ever seen a demolition derby . This looks 
like it might be the weapon that was used to kill Tom 
. Think of how much worse it could have been if Tom

. They wouldn't serve Tom a drink because he was underage .

seems to be happy is when he's with Mary . The only 
sport Tom is any good at is tennis . The only spice 
Tom puts on meat is pepper . The only restaurant that Tom 
really likes is the one across the street . The only reason 
Tom went to the party was that he expected Mary to be 
there . The only place Tom hadn't looked was in the basement 
. The only flavor ice cream that Tom eats is vanilla . 
The only fingerprints that the police found on the doorknob were Tom's. 
The only country Tom has ever lived in is Australia . The 
most dangerous thing Tom ever wanted to try to do was to 
hold a poisonous snake . The most dangerous thing Tom ever tried 
to do was bungee jumping . The last time I saw Tom 
he was walking on crutches . The last time I saw Tom 
he was as drunk as a skunk . The doctor told Tom

. The baritone sax that Tom wanted to buy was way too 
expensive for him . Starting a fight with Tom wasn't such a 
good idea . Someone stabbed Tom with an ice pick , but 
he's OK now . Some old lady told Tom that he looked 
like Charles Darwin . Since Tom wanted the chocolate much more than 
she did , Mary let him have it . Since Tom is 
a bartender , he uses an ice pick every day at work 
. Since his hands were full , Tom pushed open the door 
with his knee . Please ask Tom if he can spare another 
few minutes . Play your cards right and Tom might invite you 
to his party . People in the village still talked about the 
horrible way Tom had died . One thing Tom does that isn't 
very safe is that he uses the same password for every website 
. One afternoon in late spring , Tom went out for a 
swim and was never seen again . Nobody really cared that Tom 
didn't help . Nobody cares why Tom is a vegetarian . Nobody 
cares who Tom hired for the job . Nobody cares when Tom 
says he's leaving . Nobody cares what happens to Tom . Nobody 
can make pizza as well as Tom can . No one knew 
how much Tom loved Mary . No one else noticed that Tom 
had snuck into the room . No matter what you say , 
I don't think Tom is a nice guy . No matter what 
you do , Tom will never agree . No matter what Tom 
wears , he always looks great . No matter what I do 
, Tom always complains . No matter what happens , Tom always 
shows up on time . No matter how many people tell him 
he made a mistake , Tom still insists he's right . Neither 
Tom nor Mary was in a talkative mood . Maybe something happened 
to change Tom's plans . Mary's not pretty , but she isn't 
ugly , either . Mary wore a simple white dress . Mary 
went back to using her maiden name . Mary was definitely the 
prettiest girl at the party . Mary wanted to marry a man 
with ambition . Mary is Tom's stepmother . Mary is Tom's stepdaughter 
. Mary hired Tom to paint her house . Mary has hair 
down to her waist . Mary doesn't like it when Tom leaves 
the toilet seat up . Mary didn't wear any jewelry . Mary 
asked Tom what he thought of her dress , but he knew 
better than to tell her what he really thought . Many of 
my friends think that Tom and Mary are overprotective parents . Let 
Tom decide what you need to do . Just because Tom said 
he had never met Mary doesn't mean it's true . Just because 
Tom said he didn't have a key doesn't mean it's true . 
It's too early to tell if Tom will be able to walk 
again . It's possible that Tom will get into Harvard . It's 
possible that Tom was able to convince Mary to do his laundry 
for him . It's possible that Tom doesn't know how to unclog 
a sink . It's just a matter of time before Tom gets 
into trouble again . It's hard to believe that Tom could murder 
someone . It's been three years since Tom started working for Mary 
. It'll take Tom some time , but eventually he'll get over 
Mary . It'll take some time , but eventually Tom will be 
able to walk again . It would be virtually impossible to convince 
Tom to come along with us . It would be unethical for 
me to tell you about Tom's medical problems . It won't be 
easy persuading Mary to go . It wasn't Tom's first time to 
hear Mary sing . It wasn't Tom's first time to drive a 
sports car . It wasn't easy for Tom to tell Mary what 
she needed to hear . It was Tom's first time to see 
the Golden Gate Bridge . It was still dark when Tom left 
home for school . It was high time that Tom got out 
of there . It was hard to resist the impulse to wring 
Tom's neck . It was already dark when Tom got home . 
It took Tom every ounce of courage he had to admit to 
Mary that he had once been part of a terrorist group . 
It looks like Tom has lost a little weight . It looks 
like I was right about Tom not showing up for the meeting 
. It irritates Tom when Mary leaves the cap off the toothpaste 
. It irritates Mary when Tom leaves the toilet seat up . 
It hasn't been easy for Tom to make ends meet . It 
hasn't been easy for Tom to learn how to walk again . 
It hasn't been easy for Tom to earn enough money to support 
his large family . It hasn't been easy for Tom to deal 
with Mary's health problems . It didn't take Tom long to realize 
he wasn't welcome there . It didn't surprise me at all that 
Tom got arrested from drunken driving . It didn't surprise me at 
all that Tom didn't do what he'd told Mary he was going 
to do . It didn't surprise me at all that Tom couldn't 
afford a lawyer . If Tom hadn't helped Mary , she wouldn't 
have stood a chance of surviving . I've heard that Tom buys 
things on the black market . I'm pretty sure Tom won't do 
anything crazy . I'm looking for Tom . Have you seen him 
? I'll let you know if Tom shows up early . I'd 
love to see inside Tom's house . I wouldn't like to be 
in Tom's shoes . I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't 
swim . I would never have guessed that Tom could speak French 
so well . I would never have guessed that Tom and Mary 
would fall in love with each other . I wonder why Tom 
ever wanted to marry Mary . I wonder why Tom didn't go 
to the concert . I used to hang out with Tom a 
lot , but these days he's not around much . I tried 
to get Tom to talk to Mary . I tried to get 
Tom to ignore Mary . I tried to get Tom to help 
Mary . I tried to get Tom and Mary to play with 
John . I think Tom won't be able to catch up with 
Mary . I think Tom shares too much personal information online . 
I think Tom likes you . I think Tom likes Mary . 
I think Tom could learn a lot from you . I think 
Tom could accomplish just about anything he decides to do . I 
think Tom can do it if he tries . I think that 
Tom doesn't do drugs . I think that Tom and only Tom 
can do it . However , some people think that Mary could 
do it , too . I think it's unlikely that Tom will 
come to the party alone . I suppose Tom told you what 
happened . I like Tom's plan better than Mary's plan . I 
lent Mary the money to pay this month's rent . I imagine 
that Tom will eventually run out of money and have to go 
back home . I imagine that Tom will eventually learn to deal 
with the way people treat him . I imagine that Tom will 
eventually give up and let someone else do it . I imagine 
that Tom will eventually fire Mary . I imagine that Tom will 
eventually find out that Mary has been talking behind his back . 
I imagine that Tom will eventually figure out that Mary doesn't really 
like him . I imagine that Tom will eventually convince Mary to 
let him buy a new motorcycle . I imagine that Tom will 
eventually be caught and put in prison . I imagine that Tom 
and Mary will eventually get married . I hope Tom gets here 
on time . I hope Tom doesn't read this . I heard 
Tom split up with Mary . I heard that Tom used to 
hang out with drug dealers and murderers . I heard that Tom 
is going to turn himself in to the police . I heard 
a man's voice and thought it sounded like Tom's. I have no 
reason to believe that Tom won't do what I asked him to 
do . I have better things to do than sit around all 
day waiting for Tom . I had a feeling that Tom wasn't 
going to be able to find his dog . I had a 
feeling that Tom and Mary would decide not to buy that house 
. I don't think it's likely that Tom will come over this 
time of night . I don't think Tom is particularly handsome . 
I don't know why , but I'm sure that Tom has his 
reasons for not hiring Mary . I could kick myself for not 
inviting Tom and Mary to my party . I could have sworn 
that I saw Tom downtown today . I can't tell if Tom 
is joking or not . I can't remember the last time I 
saw Tom . I bet we'll see Tom before the end of 
the week . I asked Tom to make sure that he didn't 
show up late . I asked Tom to help me get out 
of trouble . How long have you known Tom ? Half of 
what Tom says isn't true . For all Tom knew , Mary 
might be in Boston with John . Everyone thinks Tom married Mary 
for her money . Everyone in the office was impressed with the 
way Tom handled the problem . Eventually , Tom will realize that 
he needs help . Even though Tom had promised to pay , 
he stuck Mary with the bill . Even though Tom didn't want 
to , he was too polite not to invite Mary to his 
party . During the exam , Tom cheated off Mary . Don't 
worry about Tom . He can take care of himself . Don't 
blame Tom for what Mary did . Does Tom go to church 
every Sunday ? Does Tom go to church every Sunday ? Does 
Tom get migraines often ? Does Tom get into the city very 
often ? Does Tom ever wear short pants ? Do you think 
Tom will come back tonight ? Do you think I should tell 
Tom ? Do you know where Tom's staying ? Do you know 
where Tom lives ? Do you know where Tom bought his new 
computer ? Do you know when Tom will be home ? Do 
you know what Tom looks like ? Do you have any idea 
where Tom might be ? Didn't Tom say he had something to 
tell Mary ? Did you understand what Tom was trying to say 
? Did Tom let you drive his car ? Did Tom let 
Mary drive his car ? Convincing Tom to do the right thing 
was hard . Can you think of any reason why Tom and 
Mary shouldn't get married ? By the time Tom realized what was 
going on , the police had already arrested Mary . Both Tom 
and Mary were wearing trench coats . Because Tom mistranslated one sentence 
, our company lost a lot of money . Are you on 
good terms with Tom ? All Tom wanted was for Mary to 
play a couple of tunes on her ukulele . All Tom wanted 
was for Mary to love him as much as he loved her 
. All Tom wanted was for Mary to leave him alone . 
All Tom wanted was for Mary to learn to get along with 
John . All Tom wanted was a nice hot bath . All 
the women thought Tom was really handsome . After working all day 
, Tom was really tired . After Tom dumped Mary , she 
started seeing John . A young boy , who couldn't have been 
more than five years old , asked Tom how to get to 
the post office . A lot of people feel the same way 
Tom does . We need to remember to send Tom a birthday 
card . We need to remember to pick Tom up at the 
station at 2:30. You're not responsible for what happened . You'd better 
watch what you say . You'd better be careful what you say 
. You shouldn't prejudge people . You should've quit when you were 
ahead . You should make sure that you tie a bowline . 
You should make sure that you have enough money in your pocket 
to pay for the ticket . You should have told me about 
the problem sooner . You should go see a dentist . You 
should eat more . You should assume that we won't have enough 
money to buy everything we want . You should assume that email 
messages aren't private . You should assume that anything you do online 
is public . You need to relax . You need to make 
a decision by 2:30. You need to be more careful from now 
on . You know where to find me if you need anything 
. You don't have to speak so loudly . I can hear 
you very clearly . You catch more flies with honey than you 
do with vinegar . You can't see Mt . Fuji from here 
. Would you like go out for a drink after work ? 
Would one of you be willing to lend me your bicycle for 
twenty minutes or so ? Whose idea was it to pitch the 
tent here ? Where did you get this list ? Where are 
you hurt ? What's going on out here ? What movie was 
it that you told me I should watch ? What happened to 
that friend of yours that you introduced me to last weekend ? 
What are you doing here this time of night ? We've been 
talking about you . We'd better get a move on or we'll 
be late . We should let sleeping dogs lie . We need 
to remember to put some gasoline in the car . We need 
to remember to mail this letter tomorrow . We need to prepare 
for the worst . We need to keep this confidential . We 
enjoy ourselves at the party . We don't have enough information yet 
to make a decision . Washing the car took longer than we 
expected . This type of thing never used to happen here . 
This town hasn't changed much in the last ten years . This 
is a stressful situation . This coffee is undrinkable . These apples 
are rotten . There's still a lot to be done . There's 
something I need to tell you before you leave . There's nothing 
more I can tell you . There's no need to hurry . 
We have plenty of time . There is a bird feeder in 
our backyard . There are still many things left to do . 
There are some things that you should never try doing . The 
room smelled like someone had been smoking . The reporters demanded to 
know why the mayor wouldn't talk to them . The police told 
me not to leave town . The police found a dead body 
in an abandoned car near the park . The magazines were dog-eared 
. The doctor arrived in the nick of time . The curtains 
were all open . The consequence of a wrong translation can sometimes 
be catastrophic . The breakfast dishes were still in the sink . 
That's not my job . That's not my job . Thanks for 
seeing me on such short notice . Thanks for coming on such 
short notice . Sometimes it's hard to resist the impulse to burst 
out laughing . Someone stole my tennis racket . Someone scratched my 
car . Someone broke my camera . Someone broke into my apartment 
. Some people say Japan is a male-dominated society . Some parents 
complained about the nude pictures in their children's textbooks . Shut up 
and let me think . Several guys were hanging around in front 
of the bar . Professional translators quite often specialize in just one 
field , for example law or medicine . Please cut along the 
dotted line . One problem translators face is that sometimes the source 
document is poorly written . On the plate was a piece of 
chicken , a potato and some green peas . Nobody cares how 
much the dinner is going to cost . Many , if not 
most , professional translators only translate into their native language . Let's 
wait and see how things go . Let's not rule anything out 
. Let's go get snockered like we did last weekend . Let's 
face reality . Let's change into our swimsuits and go swimming . 
Let me reiterate what I've said . It's so noisy here I 
can't hear myself think . It's nice to be back home . 
It's good to be home . It's difficult to help people who 
don't believe they need help . It's difficult to help people who 
can't admit they need help . It's difficult to help people when 
they don't want your help It's difficult to help people that don't 
want your help . It's dark in here . Do you have 
a flashlight ? It'll take some time , but I think I'll 
be able to learn how to play the guitar . It'll take 
some time until we have enough money to buy a new tractor 
. It'll take some time to shovel all the snow off the 
roof . It'll take some time to get used to wearing a 
wig . It'll take some time to get used to living here 
. It'll take some time to finish unloading the truck . It 
wasn't much of an earthquake . It wasn't much of a yard 
. It wasn't much of a view . It wasn't much of 
a storm . It wasn't much of a plan . It wasn't 
much of a party . It wasn't much of a debate . 
It wasn't much of a bridge . It takes about 15 minutes 
to get to my office . Is there something I can get 
for you ? Is there something I can do for you ? 
Is there any reason not to go ? Is that your car 
in the driveway ? In Japan , you never have to go 
too far to find a convenience store . If you want to 
achieve the kind of success that I think you do , then 
you'll have to study harder . I've got better things to do 
than to sit here listening to your gossip . I'm willing to 
try eating anything you eat . I'm willing to take care of 
your children , if you want me to . I'm willing to 
go anywhere you go . I'm too tired to think about this 
problem now . I'm too tired to drive . Could you drive 
? I'm sure you did what you thought was the right thing 
to do . I'm sorry but I can't lend you my car 
next weekend . I'm ready to start working whenever you are . 
I'm ready to leave whenever you are . I'm not in a 
position to discuss that . I'm not all that drunk . I'm 
just not cut out for this kind of work . I'm having 
fun . I'm having a hard time concentrating . I'm getting too 
old for this . I'm doing the best I can . I'm 
doing all I can . I'll let you know if I find 
anything interesting . I'll just have to improvise . I'll help you 
after work if I'm not too tired . I'll give you anything 
you want within reason . I'll do the best I can . 
I'll do everything within my power to make sure your children are 
safe . I'd rather stay home and sleep all day . I 
would prefer to only hire people to translate into their native language 
. I would never have guessed that you could buy butter for 
such a low price . I wonder if I should really become 
a teacher . I wish you could be a little quieter . 
I wish there was more I could have done . I wish 
I had a reason not to stay . I wish I had 
a reason not to go . I wish I could be more 
specific . I was wondering if I could use your computer for 
a while . I was wondering if I could borrow your newspaper 
. I told you before that I'm not interested in hanging out 
with you . I think you're cute . I think you need 
to buy a new pair of hiking boots . I think we 
still have plenty of time . I think I've forgotten something . 
I think I broke my leg . I suppose it makes sense 
to go ahead and pay the bill right now . I suggest 
you have a native speaker read over your report to make sure 
there are no errors . I plan to throw all of this 
away . You may take whatever you like . I plan to 
go . I don't care if you do or not . I 
hope you feel better tomorrow . I hope things will turn out 
well for you . I hear a lot of girls wear bikinis 
at that beach . I have better things to do than stand 
here and take your insults . I hate the tie you're wearing 
. I hadn't expected anyone to be home . I guess I 
have nothing to lose . I guess I have nothing to lose 
. I don't want to talk about it . I don't think 
your plan will work . I don't think we can really say 
that one is right and the other is wrong . I don't 
see how I can refuse . I don't know what this means 
. I don't know how else to put it . I don't 
know about you , but I feel pretty good today . I 
don't have all the facts . I don't have all the details 
. I could use some help in the kitchen . I could 
kick myself for not bringing a map . I can't really describe 
it . I can't hear what you're saying . I can understand 
your point of view . I can lend you some money if 
you need some . I can lend you some money if you 
like . He wrote down all the details . Have you ever 
been bitten by your dog ? Has your dog ever bitten you 
? Go play in traffic . Everything seems to be in order 
. Everybody was obeying the speed limit , so I knew there 
was likely a speed trap ahead . Don't worry about your dog 
. I'll take care of him . Don't blame me for your 
mistakes . Do you think the shooting was accidental ? Do you 
think that's significant ? Do you need a ride ? Do you 
know where we live ? Do you know how to get to 
our place ? Do you have someplace to stay ? Do you 
have enough time ? Do you have enough money ? Do you 
have enough energy ? Do you have enough blankets ? Do you 
have any plans for tonight ? Do you have any plans for 
today ? Do you have a girlfriend ? Do the police have 
any suspects ? Did you sleep much last night ? Did you 
get enough sleep last night ? Did you catch anything the last 
time you went fishing ? Could you please explain what's going on 
here ? Could you download a file for me ? Coming here 
was a mistake . Cleaning the garage wasn't much fun . As 
soon as I entered the class , the students started asking questions 
. I will support him . What a beautiful day ! What 
a day ! There were two pieces of cake . Modern DNA 
analysis has exonerated many people on death row in the US . 
Man is the only animal subject to becoming an imbecile . The 
basic job of an advertising agency is to figure out how to 
turn a desire into a need . My wife has the strange 
habit of pilfering wads of toilet paper from public restrooms . President 
Lincoln was assassinated with a bullet to the head , right behind 
the left ear . I don't like that . I don't love 
him . When the bell rang , the teacher ended the class 
. What are you eating ? That is beautiful . This is 
spaghetti . The dog is beautiful . This pleases me . Are 
you healthy ? You are my mother . You are my father 
. That is a boat . That is a ship . That's 
a lemon tree . John is a big boy . That's a 
blue house . This is a good house . That is a 
blue house . I went to the market . The market is 
big . Are you Chinese ? Chen is not American . Is 
he Malaysian ? Chen is not Korean . I am Korean . 
I am not Canadian . I like China . Do you like 
tea ? I like the teacher . I really like China . 
Does he like China ? He likes tea . I don't like 
tea . He likes this book . Do you like school ? 
There it is . I am in Paris . We are in 
Paris . We are in the forest . That's a tree . 
It costs 2 euros . I'm eating now . I sang for 
two hours . I ran for a mile . The baby cried 
. Has Lata come ? Has the rose blossomed ? Is the 
work done ? Why did you call me ? What is the 
time now ? Where is Mary ? Give this to Ramu . 
He heard footsteps . She is a beautiful woman . I need 
some nutmeg . It's OK with me if we barbecue , but 
I don't like it when smoke gets in my eyes . His 
advice didn't help much . His advice didn't help at all . 
His smug behavior is offensive . His smug behavior is offensive . 
His smug behavior is offensive . His briefcase was filled with water 
. The car he was riding crashed into a train . His 
death made everyone sad . There's no excuse for his delay . 
His eyes are like those of a leopard . His eyes look 
like those of a leopard . Golf is the sport that I 
don't like . She is terrible at cooking . His hands were 
blue because of the cold . His hands turned blue because it 
was so cold . His hands had turned blue because of the 
cold . His house is near the river . His house is 
near a river . His house is by the river . His 
idea is better than yours . His influence is still undiminished . 
His invention deserves attention . His new movie is disappointing . All 
he is thinking about is meeting her . The only thing he's 
thinking about is seeing her . His paper is better than mine 
. His essay is better than mine . His wish was to 
go to America . Swimming is one thing I can do fairly 
well . Painting is another thing I can do fairly well . 
Juggling is another thing I'm not very good at . Is it 
an elk ? He gave me all the money he had on 
him . John isn't the kind of man who would betray you 
. John was a lazy person until he met you . She 
was eager to go home . What does he expect ? We 
arrived in Osaka the day before yesterday . That school looks just 
like a prison . Let's discuss that problem later . She's good 
at tennis . Concerning this matter , I'm the one to blame 
. Concerning this , I'm the one to blame . I saw 
many people who had no clothes and I saw many clothes which 
had no people in them . The next day the wreck of 
the ship was discovered on the shore . I'm beginning to hate 
her . I'm starting to dislike her . Please don't talk about 
me when I'm gone . I'm beginning to see what you mean 
. I'm beginning to see a pattern . I'm beginning to doubt 
whether Tom can really understand French all that well . I'm beginning 
to believe that we'll never be able to convince Tom that he's 
wrong . I'm growing tired of all this arguing . Last century 
they would have just thrown someone like Tom into a lunatic asylum 
. I'm beginning to understand why you don't like Tom . I'm 
beginning to understand why Tom loves Boston . I'm beginning to understand 
why you don't bother to try to explain things to Tom . 
I don't pretend to understand global warming . I don't pretend to 
understand women . Tom pretended to understand Mary's poem . Tom pretended 
he didn't understand what Mary wanted him to do . Tom pretended 
not to care . I wrote the book . What's your opinion 
of the Gulf War ? What do you think about the Gulf 
War ? I have two red fish . The boy bought a 
dog . The books are ours . Are you breathing ? This 
boy is lazy . For the first time this week , I 
went out for a walk . I own a car . I 
loved her . Come over here . Where is the train ? 
Where is the bus ? I will prosper . My pants are 
too short . Tom sketched a picture of an elephant for Mary 
. Today I want to eat something light . You saved my 
life . I purchased one bag . I'm going to Paris . 
Tom woke up strapped to a gurney . It was midmorning when 
Tom finally woke up . Tom stuck his tongue out at Mary 
. Was anybody else hurt ? What did the mugger look like 
? You'd tell me if there was a problem , right ? 
How much money do you owe Tom ? How much money do 
I owe you ? I can't sleep with all this noise . 
I can't sleep with all this racket going on . How much 
money did Tom take out of the bank ? I skipped breakfast 
. I am 18 years old . What floats your boat ?

? What's wrong with being nude in your own house ? I

wine left in the bottle ? Did you kids drink it ? 
Tom knew what kind of woman Mary was . Tom was threatened 
by Mary . The police shot Tom's tires out . Do you 
have any idea when Tom will arrive ? Years ago , when 
Tom's children were young , he used to take a lot of 
pictures . How did you hear about us ? Did you hear 
about the big earthquake in Japan ? Did you hear about Tom's 
accident ? Did you hear about Tom's fight with Mary ? Did 
you hear about Tom's promotion ? Did you hear about Tom's resignation 
? Did you hear about what happened last night ? Where do 
you stay ? Did Tom say what he needed the money for 
? Did Tom seem upset ? Perhaps I can be of some 
assistance . Grab him ! Don't let him get away . I 
heard they're going to raise our rent . Let me explain to 
you how this works . Does Tom always carry a gun ? 
How do you suppose Tom found us ? How do you think 
Tom found us ? Everyone considers him to be honest . Buy 
the full version I am not kidding . They really wanted to 
know what happened . He really wants to buy a new motorcycle 
. She really wanted to tell the secret . I have work 
to do , so go away and leave me alone . It 
never occurred to me that Tom wouldn't come . Where do you 
think you're going ? We never use sugar . Kate had a 
cold . Did she say that ? I believe you know what 
this is all about . I believe you know what I mean 
. I'm from Brazil . In the morning , I like to 
put honey on my toast . He ran so he would get 
there on time . Tom contacted me the other day asking me 
if I'd play guitar for a charity concert . I can't tell 
you . It's a secret and if I told you , it 
wouldn't be a secret anymore . Why is she here ? I 
have three chickens in my house . The soup is too hot 
. Black cats are bad luck . In Japanese folklore , bakeneko 
are cats with magical powers . I wonder why some people think 
black cats are unlucky . It's a perfect trap . I want 
to kill someone . I want to kill somebody . He's a 
liar . I'm already done . The cat is black . Singing 
is an honest and pleasurable entertainment , but one must be careful 
to avoid singing or taking pleasure in listening to lewd songs . 
Give me a little more time . I'm on my way out 
. She can handle it . She is a virtuous woman . 
What did you mean by this sentence ? This has no relevance 
to my background . He painted a dog . Fight like a 
man ! My cat is wet . There is no escape . 
You got it . What have you done ? You blockhead ! 
Open fire ! It's finally over . I can't believe this . 
I'm so hungry . He was my friend . It is our 
destiny . It's our destiny . I can't go back . This 
is the person I spoke about the other day , Tom is 
the type of person who always demands that something be done rather 
than request that it be done . Tom is the type of 
person who always has to have the last word . Tom seems 
to enjoy provoking arguments . Tom seems to enjoy watching horror movies 
. Tom seems to enjoy being outdoors . He's a teetotaller . 
Maybe they are happy . That thought was momentary . Isn't there 
a much better and shorter way of saying the same thing ? 
This is the watch that I'd lost . Tom thinks that Mary 
wears too much makeup . Tom took his place at the table 
. Tom took his place at head of the table . Tom 
sat down at the table . How many died ? I'm not 
an idiot . I'm not stupid . I'm not as stupid as 
you think I am . This picture reminds me of when I 
was a student . Tom has written hundreds of songs . Tom

French . It's been a long time since I've heard Tom play 
his baritone sax . It's been a long time since I've seen 
you smile . It's been a long time since I've seen you 
smile . It's been a long time since I've worn a tie 
. That was awesome . I'll introduce you to the team . 
What are you here for ? Why﻿ are you mad ? He's 
not my father . He's your father . Men are pigs . 
You're amazing . Times have changed . We are free ! Tom 
is very popular . Someone saved my life . This isn't normal 
. This ain't normal . Check this out . You people are 
amazing . I'm ready to go . Try to find it . 
This is bad . I'm here to save you . You're pretty 
good . You're a funny guy . You're a funny girl . 
You're a funny gal . Sorry , I forgot . You go 
on without me . You look just like him . This sounds 
fishy . Is he still alive ? I'll be a good girl 
. I changed my mind . See you there . I twisted 
my ankle . Are you hurt ? Don't do it ! My 
grandpa is good at shogi . His level is fourth dan , 
amateur . Sometimes it's better to just not say anything . It's 
not easy to speak a foreign language . Oranges have a lot 
of vitamin C. I'm afraid of heights . You're incredible . Spring 
is coming . Who is this guy ? Is your dog mean 
? Tom is an excellent cricket player . Don't die on me 
. I don't fear death . We'll never make it . Ask 
her for advice . Ask him for advice . She got brushed 
aside . Hop in . Why do you want to die ? 
I'm right beside you . We're on schedule . I thought he 
was here . We were right . Ironic , isn't it ? 
Take a look at this . I can't tell you yet . 
Where was he headed ? I'm being watched . You're surrounded . 
I shouldn't be laughing . I'm scared . My place is here 
. We'll begin shortly . I'm such an idiot . Don't fall 
off ! Go on ahead . Get us out of here . 
It's no use . He saved my life . She is wiser 
than I am . Are you deaf ? What's your secret ? 
What is wrong with you ? What is wrong with him ? 
What is wrong with her ? Stay out of my way . 
You need to hurry . Will he live ? It's only a 
game . It's not just a game . Are you sure about 
this ? I've got bad news . Here I come . Here 
she comes . I have to apologize . That no longer matters 
. This no longer matters . It no longer matters . She 
told me everything . He told me everything . Don't wake her 
up . I have no future . This is my destiny . 
Be careful out there . That door is locked . The door 
is locked . She betrayed you . He betrayed you . They 
betrayed you . I betrayed you . This dog runs fast . 
Something's coming . It's on the house . You did it ! 
What kind of places do you like ? I play bass guitar 
in a guitar ensemble . Do you think I should go by 
myself ? This is not a drill . The water is hot

? Sara has 31 pens . I had to wait more than 
three hours . It's two o'clock in the morning . It's a

this to me . Tom has been fired . Tom looks confused 
. Tom is running . Tom is working . He's your son 
. I wanted to tell you . I'm no longer afraid .

. We're having fun . When is he coming back ? He 
needs to be alone . I need to be alone . I'm 
not crying . Where in Turkey do you live ? Which is 
correct ? Tom went to Boston . The speaker is young . 
Write a short essay . Do you live in Turkey ? Do 
you live in Turkey ? Tom still doesn't live in Boston . 
Tom knows nothing about Boston . He spends too much money . 
We are in a library . We're in a library . Let's 
do it ! I arrived too early . The statue has no 
head . Is there an ATM nearby ? Black suits you .

have come . Let me help you up . Do you drink 
wine ? Get her out of here . Hold on a second

him carry his luggage upstairs . I think it's important to tell 
him the facts . In the future , be more careful with 
your money . From now on , be more careful with your 
money . When I was a child , I believed in Santa

I worked on Mr . Wood's farm when I was young . 
My body is not as flexible as it used to be . 
No one can live to be two hundred years old . The

insults any longer . I found the key I had been looking 
for . I studied really hard in order to pass the exam

asleep . That was great . It was superb . What'll we 
do ? My father spoils me . Keep your eye on him 
. I'll update it soon . What's he up to ? It's 
hard to tell . Here we go again . The man you 
met yesterday was Mr . Brown . There was no time left 
for an explanation . The man standing over there is Mr . 
Smith . He finally realized that he was wrong . I should 
go . Why do you come here ? Why are you here

together . We won't tell anyone . We won't lose . We 
won this time . We will not fail . We will fix 
this . We were worried . We were worried sick . We 
were just friends . We were here first . We were having 
fun . We were best friends . We understand . We tried 
to save Tom . We thought you knew . We still have 
time . We should've gone there ourselves . We should set a 
trap . We should go . We should get going . We 
should call Tom . We need to leave . We need to 
hurry . We need to help Tom . We need to go 
. We need to get going . We need this . We 
need more time . We need help . We need evidence .

a car . We must do it again . We must be 
careful . We live together . We just need a plan . 
We just moved in . We just got started . We just 
got here . We just fed the baby . We heard a 
noise . We haven't met yet . We have work to do 
. We have to talk . We have to move . We 
have to leave now . We have to hurry . We have 
to go now . We have to do better . We have 
things to do . We have no secrets . We have guests 
. We had no secrets . We had a blast . We

do that . We can't allow that . We can help you 
. We can help Tom . We can handle that . We 
can do that . We both saw you . We aren't married 
. We aren't alone . We all have secrets . He has 
a dark secret . This will be easy . Afterwards , he 
assumed a new identity . I have enough money . We have 
enough money . The school is closed . There's a catch . 
Stand back ! How good are you ? How good is he 
? He was invited . He is very talented . He's a 
bit shy . Justice will prevail . Love will prevail . Meet 
me in the hot tub . I appreciate this . Hang on 
tight . He's outraged . Where are the others ? Everyone noticed 
. He's a jerk . Let him go ! He used his 
head . I really love cats . He's a cat lover . 
It's too dangerous ! He has left us . Let's take a 
vote . Let's split . Let's not talk . Let's make a 
trade . Let's find out . Let's do business . It's your 
fault . It's worth it . It's way too heavy . It's 
very effective . It's too late . It's too easy . It's 
too dark . It's time to party . It's safe here . 
It's poison . It's personal . It's not too much . It's 
not too deep . It's not safe here . It's not fair 
. It's hopeless . It's gorgeous . It's different . It's dangerous 
here . It's cold out . It's cold out there . It's 
cold in here . It's close by . It's been tried . 
It's beautiful . It's all here . It's a weapon . It's 
a rental . It's a little scary . There are some things 
that are difficult to translate . Some things are perhaps not worth 
translating . Tom felt that it would be a waste of time 
to translate the letter for Mary . Even though Tom translated the 
letter for Mary , she didn't bother to read his translation . 
The time has flown . The time has passed very quickly .

Tom . You may go now . You look relieved . You 
look nervous . You look familiar . You lied to me again 
. You know your rights . You know what I want .

You are impossible . You are a genius . You always say 
that . You almost died . It could be fun . It 
could be worse . It didn't work . It feels really good 
. It may take a while . It was a gift . 
It was all my fault . It was an accident . It 
was perfect . It was so beautiful . It was worth a 
try . It was worth it . It wasn't very good . 
It won't take long . It'll be our secret . That didn't 
work . That explains it . That might be true . That 
sounds awesome . That sounds exciting . That sounds horrible . That 
sounds like fun . That tastes terrible . That was easy . 
That was really bad . That was very good . That wasn't 
funny . That wasn't so hard . That wasn't your job . 
That would be great . That's a joke . That's a myth 
. That's a plan . That's an old joke . That's correct 
. That's embarrassing . That's for you . That's funny . That's 
hilarious . That's interesting . That's my doll . That's my job 
. That's not an option . That's not bad . That's not 
good . That's not my fault . That's not my name .

so great . That's so sweet . That's stupid . That's too 
personal . That's too personal . That's unacceptable . That's very cool

your job . That's your problem . You must be strong . 
There's no danger . Sound the alarm ! It belongs to me 
. Where's Tom from ? What a perfect night ! Welcome to 
Boston . Trust is earned . Those are mine . This time 
we won . This seems risky . This place is creepy . 
This one's yours . This one's Tom's. This isn't possible . This 
isn't funny . This isn't for you . This isn't a party 
. This is weird . This is very fresh . This is 
useless . This is the best . This is so weird . 
This is ridiculous . This is really bad . This is perfect 
. This is not good . This is not a game . 
This is my wife . This is my son . This is 
my place . This is my phone . This is my painting 
. This is my husband . This is my fault . This 
is my baby . This is creepy . This is a nice 
place . This is a joke . They're with me . They're 
stalling . They're not a threat . They're lying . They're gone 
. They're expensive . They're cool . They're coming . They're armed 
. They ruined it . They haven't hurt me . They didn't 
even know who they were supposed to meet . They deported Tom 
. These are beautiful . There's still time . There is one 
problem . The room was quiet . The room is empty . 
The radio is on . The lid is closed . The gun 
isn't loaded . The choice is yours . That belongs to me 
. Thanks for the help . Thanks for the cake . Thanks 
for that . Thanks for dinner . Something's wrong . Someone's outside 
. See you guys later . Please pull over . Please help 
Tom . Please go away . Please don't shoot . Please don't 
hate me . Please don't go . Please don't fight . Please 
don't do this . Please don't do that . Perhaps you're right 
. Now you owe me . Now I know why . Now 
I feel bad . Nobody can help me . No one said 
anything . My pen is out of ink . Maybe Tom likes 
you . Maybe Tom is in love . Maybe I was wrong 
. Mary isn't my sister . Mary is so pretty . Mary 
is not my type . Mary hugged her doll . Mary came 
on her own . Look what happened . Listen to this . 
Let the boy go . Last night was fun . Just take 
one . How interesting ! Hey . That's not fair . Hey 
. I know you . Here comes Tom . Everything's gone . 
Everything was lost . Everyone's shocked . Everyone's asleep . Everybody's crying 
. Driving relaxes me . Do what Tom says . Both girls 
laughed . We'll do it tomorrow . You have a big nose 
. Wind up the clock . When did you come ? She 
married a sailor . The sea is calm . You look like 
a girl . He looks like a girl . She looks like 
a boy . You look like a boy . Tom is waiting 
. You must find work . He must find work . Take 
what you need . He's so young . He exhaled loudly . 
We agreed on a price . I bought a VIP pass . 
He treated me badly . He showed it to me . Wait 
a minute , Tom ! Don't show your cards He's a slob 
. He found it . They found it . He was not 
pleased . I was not pleased . This is not funny . 
It happened so fast . Your face is pale . She calculates 
faster than any other student . He pressured me . Can I 
go out to play ? Tom has a short fuse . He 
is a beginner . She's not my sister . Take only one 
. You must do as I say . They want you dead 
. Tom wants you dead . It's not for sale . Do 
you trust Tom ? He pushed her away . Tom drives a 
Datsun . It's all I have . I'm bad at swimming . 
We survived ! Is anyone looking ? Is he looking ? Are 
you looking ? She's a looker . Coffee , please . I 
did it willingly . He did it willingly . It felt good 
. It feels good . He told me about it . It 
never gets old . This never gets old . I would do 
it again . They should sue Tom . They look relieved . 
It was an inside job . Nightmares are scary . I can't 
eat this . I can't eat pork . Tom can't eat pork 
. Do cats dream ? He's greedy and lazy . What I 
did was wrong . She made me cookies . He made me 
a cake . Eat your vegetables . Eat your veggies . Stop 
hitting me ! Go brush your teeth . Stop hitting the cat 
! Stop it right now ! Stop yelling ! Go to your 
room ! How was school today ? The other children call him 
Fatty . I can't wait . I want to quit . Tom 
wants to quit . I hate my life . He hates his 
life . What was I saying ? My sister is a moron 
. My brother is stupid . Have you told Tom ? He 
studied hard . We nearly starved . I nearly starved . Let's 
toss a coin . Tom tried to stand up , but he 
couldn't. Tom said it was too risky to go there alone . 
A young boy in a wheelchair asked Tom what time it was 
. Let's flip a coin . During the entire lesson he counted 
flies . She performed her daily duties without any passion . As 
if I didn't know that ! Is it new ? " I 
am very happy " , he said . I'll let you know 
. That's an order . He's never satisfied . Empty your pockets 
! Do what you have to do . Just do what you 
have to do . We left together . He showed me the 
way . I showed him the way . He leaned towards me 
. He pushed me gently . Bring me my shoes . Pass 
me the potatoes . She's not my type . You're not my 
type . Can I sleep here ? I'm not available . He's 
not available . He's not available . He's a bit drunk . 
He's a bit tipsy . I'm a bit tipsy . Atlantis is 
real . Please stop talking . Here , look at this . 
Here , take this . Tom has gone AWOL . He grabbed 
my arm . We must do it now . I must do 
it now . Kids are cruel . Stop being cruel . I 
had little choice . I'll call the chef . He's very lonely 
. He removed his shirt . He's already married . Do you 
see a rose ? I see a rose . Do you see 
a star ? I see a star . I see a queen 
. Do you see my pen ? I see a crown . 
What a cute baby ! Which one is correct ? How beautiful 
! How clever Tom is ! How curious ! How strange ! 
How very curious ! What a big truck ! What a funny 
man ! What a horrible man ! What a lot of pens 
! What a lovely dress ! What a nice tie ! What 
a selfish woman ! What a smart guy ! What a strange 
dog ! What a strange man ! She knew what needed to 
be done . He declined to answer the questions put to him 
. He can't whistle . How arrogant ! That was different . 
Be proud of yourself . I'm not ashamed . Nothing can stop 
him . Nothing can stop me . The pay is meager . 
He likes cantaloupe . He's after me . He's after me . 
He likes Indian food . Call us . Everyone noticed her . 
Can we believe that ? A dog's nose is very sensitive . 
It's no secret . I'm fine , thanks ! I'll be damned 
, if by the end of the movie the chef doesn't turn 
out to be the killer . Let's finish the job . His 
father became ill with cancer . It's a matter of life and 
death . We both fell asleep . I've got them all . 
Do you wear glasses ? Stop dating losers ! I refuse to 
answer . It's moist and warm . Do you like it then 
? Get off my back ! Do you think anyone can see 
me ? I can confirm this . I can't confirm this . 
Do I look fat ? He's a bigot . He loves attention 
. He decided not to go . I don't drink . He 
doesn't drink . I heard everything . A DNA test showed he 
was innocent . Would you like to have tea with us this 
afternoon ? We laughed . I feel like an idiot . I 
felt like an idiot . He likes my jokes . Do you 
disagree ? I hate sand . He's going bald . I'm going 
bald . We heard a gunshot . How hard can that be 
? Thank you my dear . What have we done ? I'm 
not blushing ! I will teach you . Think for a moment 
. Don't blame yourself . You were fantastic . There are many 
housewives who complain about high prices . I want to be alone 
! He kissed her . What's the next step to be done 
? He has small feet . Is there anything important ? You 
had better not do that . Visit us tomorrow . Tom was 
an orphan . What is your advice ? I don't feel like 
it anyway ! We need a steamboat . It's annoying . That's 
annoying . Is this annoying ? Am I annoying you ? It 
doesn't bother me . What an idiot ! It’s just midnight . 
I think I hear them . Tie him to a tree . 
We should talk calmly to each other . Do you know how 
it feels to translate a hundred similar variations of a sentence ? 
She wants something very special for her birthday . I love your 
daughter . I love your son . I love his son . 
Tom is an art dealer . How could it be ? How 
can it be ? How bad can it be ? Did he 
say something ? Think of your family . He's a southpaw . 
Wake up Tom ! You're such a liar . He's no saint 
. I'm no saint . Tom is no saint . I got 
a C in English . I got a B in physics . 
I appreciate that . Mary is left-handed . His wife was mad 
. His wife is mad . My wife was mad . My 
wife is mad . Come down here ! Take the next right 
. I owe you nothing . I owe him nothing . Will 
I see you later ? Isn't she a knockout ? She's a 
knockout . I'm a police officer . Get off my lawn . 
I knew it was wrong . He relented . His eyes widened 
. Get out of my bed . She's a babe . I 
saw him first . I saw it first . He winked at 
her . He kissed her again . He kissed her deeply . 
I have dishonored my family . Give me another beer . Get 
me another beer . He's in trouble . I'm not your slave 
. We're not dating . My friend helped me . Don't look 
at me ! Don't look at him ! It's getting dark . 
You will regret this . He will regret this . He refused 
to pay . I refused to pay . I want vengeance . 
He wants vengeance . I want a beer . He looks very 
good . There's no hope . There isn't any hope . There 
isn't any hope . Let me go . Let him go . 
Let Tom go . He let me go . He let Tom 
go . He let us go . There is no hope . 
Would you rather be fat and ugly or thin and sexy ?

I'd like to join you . I'd like to help . I'd 
like to help you . I'd like to do that . I'd 
like to be alone . I'm sore all over . Please correct

eyebrows . She met her uncle . Please sing . Go to 
the store . Do you want wine ? That's a great start 
! What is it now ? Look at that ! I do 
notice it . I believe it's time to wake up Robert .

real hottie . Please wait a minute . Today , the weather 
in Istanbul is really sunny . The milkman died . Stop . 
You're hurting me . Stop ! You're making him cry . I 
don't want to stop . Stop staring . I'm too old for 
you . I'm too old for her . She's too old for 
you . He's too old for you . He's too old for 
her . He's too old for me . Give it back to 
him . Give it back to her . These clothes are too 
small for her . I'm not your son . I'm not your 
father . I'm not your mother . Show me some respect . 
What the hell does Tom know about that ? What the hell 
do you know about that ? What the hell does he know 
about that ? What the hell does she know about that ?
